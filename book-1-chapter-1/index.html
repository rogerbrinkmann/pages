<h2 id="section-1-the-true-ancestors">Section 1. The True Ancestors</h2>
<h3 id="the-perfected-adam-and-eve">The perfected Adam and Eve</h3>
<p><em>God created human beings to experience joy for eternity. Adam and Eve, the first ancestors of
humankind, were created to be the object partners of God's absolute true love. Humanity had to
originate from one ancestral couple. God created true love to flow in one stream; hence, He
cannot begin another stream of true love from someone other than one man and one woman. If
Adam and Eve had become perfect through God's absolute love and multiplied good descendants,
they could have realized an ideal family. Everyone in that family would have attended God the
Creator as their vertical, incorporeal true parent and perfected Adam and Eve as their
horizontal, substantial true parents on earth.</em></p>
<p><em>Adam and Eve's true family would have expanded into Adam and Eve's clan. Their clan would
have prospered, expanded into a society and nation, and ultimately built a world that fulfilled
God's three great blessings to "be fruitful, and multiply, and have dominion over all things." That
world would have been nothing less than the ideal kingdom of heaven that God intended to build
on earth.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From seeing Adam and Eve who were created in His image, we can understand that God exists with the
dual characteristics of masculinity and femininity. It is because God has both of these characteristics that
God created Adam and Eve. Therefore, Adam and Eve needed to become one as subject partner and
object partner, as a perfect man and a perfect woman. Had they done so, they would have reached a
position equal to that of God. Then they would have given birth to sons and daughters and given them the
same love that God gave them when creating them.
Human beings were God's greatest masterpieces among all created beings. He created them so that they
could also stand in the position of creating such masterpieces, human beings, as their children. God
therefore expected Adam and Eve to become completely one as husband and wife. Then, when looking at
the children born from their perfect union, Adam and Eve would have inherited the tremendous joy that
God experienced when He created them.
God imbued Adam and Eve with the love that would have enabled them to give birth to children and love
them with that very love. In other words, Adam and Eve, being God's beloved children, totally received
every single thing that God, the Absolute Being, had within Him. (053-166, 1972/02/19) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original Adam and Eve were God's body. What I am saying is that these originally good ancestors
of humanity were to be a substantial manifestation of God. God wanted to enter their minds and become
one with them in physical form. In that state, even as God wanted to give them more and more, they --
God and human beings -- would revolve around each other. Spinning like a rotor, they would become
completely one.
Had such seeds of love been sown, their descendants, humankind, would have borne the fruit. Then, no
matter how far you dissected that seed, its core substance would never change. However, because of the
Fall, that seed needs to be dismantled and repaired; it must be fundamentally repaired, but this is
impossible unless they bring God back into their lives and attend Him.
God created heaven and earth in order to share His life and love. This is why God, the incorporeal One,
brings forth a man and a woman as the eternal embodiments of His love. They are the True Parents, the
good human ancestors, whom He now introduces to humanity as the central substance of His love. (038-
173, 1971/01/03) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original Adam and Eve were to have been the True Parents. As Father and Mother, they would
have been the center of the family and regarded as the king and queen of the family. Their sons and
daughters would have been the heirs who could become future kings and queens. If the original ancestors,
Adam and Eve, had not fallen, God would have been the Grandparent who bequeathed His kingship to
their family. That is why the True Father and True Mother are the king and queen of their family and
represent all families in all nations. They are the original king and queen of the family, and you as their
sons and daughters are in the position of princes and princesses who will inherit their kingship in the
future as members of the royal family. (221-255, 1991/10/25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the Fall of the human ancestors, God lost the true ancestors of humankind as He had envisioned
them according to the ideal of creation. Human beings, no matter how great or how wealthy, even if they
have the power to move the entire world, are still from the lineage of the fallen ancestors. This is a most
lamentable truth. People who are descended from the fallen ancestors are bound to plummet down to
Satan's hell. People throughout history have been searching for the original Lord, the original Parents who
are the true ancestors who can embrace fallen humanity as their true children. For this, God strove to
recover the positions of Adam and Eve prior to the Fall, following the path of restoration continually for
4,000 years, (154-261, 1964/10/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam and Eve, had they not fallen, would have become the true ancestors of humankind. They would
have become the True Father and True Mother, the True Parents of humankind, in the flesh. However,
Adam and Eve fell, and humankind became Satan's children. Suppose Adam and Eve had not fallen, but
instead had become a man and woman imbued with God's heart. They would have joined in holy
matrimony as God rejoiced over them, and become the True Parents of humankind. Then the created
world would have united with them in harmony, and joyfully provided their family with everything they
needed.
Had Adam and Eve become a true son and daughter before God, had they become a true husband and
wife as the model for all human beings, and had they become the True Parents of humankind who could
attend God as their eternal Parent, they would have been able to sing with joy and happiness throughout
their lives. No one would ever have been able to lead them away, because they would have belonged
solely to the one Lord. Their heart and their love would have belonged to the one Lord. Their one Lord
would have been God. (009-137, 1960/05/01) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fall disrupted Adam's family. Therefore, the goal of restoration, to return to the original state
before the Fall, is to restore Adam's family. God first strives to recover one individual who will be His
partner; then he strives to recover one central family. Only after that can He strive to recover a church, a
people, a nation and then the world.
Throughout history, God has been seeking a family that could become His ideal object partner. Such is
the True Family. The True Family is fundamentally different in substance from ordinary families. Unless
that God-centered family can be recovered and aligned with God's ideal, there is no way to recover the
ideal for the nation or the world. This is the reason that God must first establish the original True Family.
Similarly, salvation cannot be attained by individuals; rather, the basic unit of salvation is a true family.
Had it not been for the Fall, Adam and Eve would have become the ideal husband and wife and, one-step
further, the True Parents. They would have become the True Parents to their posterity and all humankind.
Had humanity prospered with Adam and Eve as the True Parents, they would have built one great family
and established the world of peace in the Adamic cultural sphere. (294-067, 1998/06/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history of God's providence of restoration is a sorrowful history. The fact that God lost Adam and
Eve is something to grieve over. The problem is that this loss did not end with those two individuals
alone. Losing them meant losing their clan, and this lost clan has since expanded into peoples, nations and
the world. By losing Adam and Eve, God lost them all. Thus, the loss of Adam and Eve meant that God's
kingdom and His sovereignty were lost. It meant the loss of God's family, God's clan and the people for
His kingdom. It meant the loss of the ideal of man and woman, the loss of God's only son and daughter.
That is why the history of salvation, namely the history of the providence of restoration, is to recover one
man and one woman, Adam and Eve. If Adam and Eve had not fallen but had prospered, today every
single human being among the many billions of people on our planet would be registered in the heavenly
kingdom. Everyone would naturally enter the heavenly kingdom as one family. (143-025, 1986/03/15) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the fall of the first human ancestors, people could neither have true ancestors nor be true
descendants. Even God could not stand in the position of True God. Nothing was centered on God, so
there was no basis to build a true family, a true society or a true nation. For this reason, we must seek the
true root, and when we find it we will also find the nation in which everyone can live together as one true
family. That is why, through the providence of salvation, God has sought to build the one world, the
world of hope, true peace, love and oneness. To realize this purpose, God sends the Savior. The True
Parents must come to earth and teach humanity to make God their central focus as individuals, and to put
God at the center of the family, the nation and the world; by doing so, they are trying to return all
humankind to the original world. Such is the course of the providence. (267-297, 1995/02/05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God's hope is not for the Lord to return on the clouds in the sky and build a spiritual kingdom like a
fantasy world. The reason he returns is to plant his feet on the ground and find the one Bride who can
receive God's total love. He does this work to recover all that was lost because 6,000 years ago the first
human ancestors became the false ancestors.
Therefore, in the course of history, a perfect woman must emerge who is absolutely connected to God's
love. She must join with the perfect man who lives in oneness with God's love. She is able to stand as the
Bride of the Returning Lord, who comes as the Bridegroom. That time is at hand.
When they unite in this position, they are at the level of Adam and Eve before the Fall, when they were
loved by God in the Garden of Eden. They have reached the point to receive from God the three great
blessings. With them emerges the foundational point on earth that Satan cannot invade. Had Adam and
Eve stood in this victorious position as the ancestors of humankind, the archangel Lucifer would not have
become Satan; rather, he would have attended them as a faithful servant. This is the Principle of Creation.
Because they lost that position, since that time, human beings been orphans. Therefore, the True Parents
of humankind, who can recover this position, must appear on earth. (022-084, 1969/01/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original Adam was one individual, yet he was meant to be the center of the family, the tribe, the
nation and the world. The culture would have been Adam's culture. From that culture, a language would
have begun. Thus, everything would have developed and prospered. Accordingly, all the events that
connect to True Parents can become sources for creating a new culture. From this new culture, a true
history of humankind can finally unfold. True families, societies, peoples, nations and a true world can
emerge.
The teachings that True Parents have established as the tradition will be central in every age. Thus far,
human beings have based their hope for the world in a vision of the future, but no longer. Rather than
looking forward to something yet to be realized, we will advance centering on the teachings that True
Parents are practicing here and now. It is based upon their teachings that history will advance. The
heavenly nation to be erected based on those teachings will establish the center of the past, the present
and the future. Once this nation is inaugurated, its culture will not be short-lived. It will extend to the
world, and remain alive and well, becoming the source for future cultural development. There will be
total oneness. It will be the same, whether at the beginning or the end. (050-251, 1971/11/07) </p>

<p><em>We read in the Bible, in the book of Genesis, about the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil that grew in the Garden of Eden. These two trees symbolize the perfect father
and mother. Originally, the human ancestors, Adam and Eve, perfect and having nothing to do
with the Fall, were to have been the roots of humankind. Having grown from those roots, all
people were destined to live in the kingdom of heaven on earth. After death, they would have
passed on to the kingdom of heaven in heaven and lived there eternally.
God's purpose of creation is for humanity to form a single God-centered family, in which all
would be kin. Fallen human beings are wild olive trees, stemming from wild roots. They need to
receive a graft from the true olive trees, True Parents, and be reborn as true human beings. By so
doing, humanity can realize the world according to God's ideal of creation, the eternal ideal
kingdom of heaven that should have sprouted from the Garden of Eden. The hope of humanity is
to receive the True Parents, adopt the good traditions of their God-centered family, hand them
down generation after generation, and thus build a united world of one language, one culture and
one sovereignty of God.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>True Parents are totally united with the love and lineage of the absolute God. Hence, we can call True
Parents' family, which they established after their Holy Wedding, the true olive trees, while people in the
fallen world are false olive trees. Then, if we make a cut in a false olive tree and graft a cutting from a
true olive tree onto it, it will eventually belong to the family of the true olive trees. This will connect
people to God's true love, true life, true lineage and true conscience, and they can reach perfection. When
they do, the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven will unfold.
God could not have His third generation, His grandsons and granddaughters. Satan has them and even has
tribes of his own; they have multiplied to this day and built numerous countries. God, on the other hand,
has never had even one perfect man or one perfect woman. The Messiah is the one who comes as the
perfect man. He must find his Bride and establish the position of the True Parents through their marriage
and by having children. On this basis, he can restore the original family of humankind. (344-198,
2001/03/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had Adam and Eve become the True Parents of humankind, we would not have needed the Savior or
religion. God would have found joy in the world of goodness that had no need for religion. God wanted to
build such a world on earth, but His desire was not fulfilled. The Fall means that Adam and Eve failed to
unite with God. As a consequence, they failed to become True Parents; they became false parents instead.
Therefore, you must move from the false parents' lineage and return to God through the True Parents'
lineage. You are all descendants of those false olive trees. You should have been true olive trees, but you
became false olive trees who need to be reborn by receiving a graft from the true olive trees. (023-162,
1969/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents come as God's true olive trees. They are the ones who will give you rebirth. We cannot
be born without parents; it is the law of heaven. True Parents come to earth having the root of God's true
love, true life and true lineage. Their mission is to cut down to their stumps the trees of fallen people,
which were born from the root of false love, and graft the cuttings of true love onto them. We human
beings must find the root of God's true love that comes from the true olive trees. Only in True Parents is it
possible to find that root. (494-013, 2005/04/27) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The True Parents come with true love and true lineage. The false parents entangled human beings in
false love and false lineage. We must build God-centered true families in the original world free of the
Fall. To build families of true sons and daughters, we need to connect to the true lineage. To become True
Parents' children, we must connect to their lineage. The parent-child relationship, or the father-son
relationship, is absolutely impossible without the bond of blood. Not even God can sever that bond. Nor
can Satan do it.
For this reason, to usher in the Completed Testament Age we must receive the marriage Blessing of True
Parents. That way we can restore through indemnity the failures of the Old and New Testament Ages.
You were an orchard of false olive trees, but now you must become an orchard of true olive trees by
receiving the graft of God's true lineage, the original standard. For this, you must achieve oneness in
heart, oneness in body and oneness in thought with True Parents, based on true love. (347-174,
2001/07/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents refer to perfected Adam and Eve. It is this Adam and Eve who come to establish true
families, true tribes, true peoples, the true nations, the true world, the kingdom of heaven on earth and the
kingdom of heaven in heaven, finally even liberating God. True Parents stand in the position to fulfill
everything on every level. They are the most precious beings that God ever sent to this world. When you
follow them with absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience, you are certain to overcome any
obstacle.
True Parents bequeath true love, true life and true lineage. As children, we inherit these. The purpose of
all religions is to lay the foundation on earth to inherit True Parents' accomplishments. Salvation cannot
be accomplished without a connection to true love, true life and true lineage. The world is fallen because
the false parents bound humankind with false love, life and lineage, with the result that human beings fell
into hell. In order to turn this around 180 degrees, True Parents must emerge and connect humankind to
true love, true life and true lineage. The marriage Blessing engrafts cuttings from the true olive trees onto
the false olive trees. (362-011, 2001/12/02) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents come as the true olive trees. When the false children of this world receive a graft from
the true olive trees, they can then be harvested as restored, reborn fruits that are free from the Fall and
stored in the barns of the heavenly kingdom. This is the responsibility of the Messiah on earth. The
Messiah comes with the seed of true children based on true love. Due to the bonds of false love, false life
and false lineage that resulted from the Fall, human beings became children of the enemy Satan, children
whom God did not desire. Since they were tied to that lineage by false love, God has been conducting the
providence of salvation to purify them. (252-228, 1994/01/01) </p>
