## Chapter 1 True Father Begins His Course of Public Life

### Section 4 Hungnam Prison

#### Inheriting Jesus' mission
True Fathers suffering in Hungnam Prison was the indemnity course that made it possible for
him, as the Returning Lord, to continue Jesus' mission. For the Returning Lord to continue Jesus'
mission, he needed to survive despite the opposition of Christian believers. He could not die on
the cross as Jesus had. Additionally, the Lord at the Second Advent had to find more disciples
than the 12 who abandoned Jesus at the time of his crucifixion. Hungnam Prison in North Korea
was like the cross. It too killed its inmates slowly and gradually. True Father not only had to
survive but also had to find and establish more than 12 disciples. He was not allowed to witness
to those around him, but even so, ancestors of the prisoners appeared to them in dreams and
taught them to serve True Father and attend him well. When True Father finally left prison, he
had more than 24 disciples.  
For the first two weeks of his imprisonment at Hungnam, he shared half of his rations with
cellmates. His mother in Jeongju took great pains to prepare powdered mixed grains and clothes
for him, but he gave them all to other inmates. Moreover, during the course of his imprisonment,
he was given the exemplary laborer award three times. Father always kept a little of his daily
ration of drinking water to clean his body before going to bed. He did this with the awareness
that he was God's Son. In these ways, he led such an exemplary life that God Himself could not
help but be moved.

1. In the spirit world, Jesus had to go to the bottom of hell for three days after his crucifixion and
overcome a path of suffering there, to make the starting point of victory both in spirit and flesh. Unless he
was able to open the way to liberate those in hell, Satan would be able to accuse him; therefore, he had to
make a way for them. This is the reason Jesus went to the spirits in hell and pioneered a way for them.
Because I knew this principle, when I went to North Korea I was willing to go to prison there.  
Even while I was being led away in shackles for incarceration in Pyongyang Prison, I was promised by
the spirit world that I would meet certain people in prison. In other words, I was promised, "If you go
there, you will meet people who are like Jesus' three disciples." If this were not so, it would not be in
accord with heavenly laws that govern the realm of fortune and restoration. That is why even the path of
shackles and imprisonment can be the path of the greatest hope. In other words, I actually went to prison
with hope and expectation. I knew, "I will meet such and such a person." I did not go to prison in despair.
Since I went to prison with such a hope, at the prison I made my own way, and through the merit of that
hard labor I enabled that door to be opened naturally. To do this, I had to make a total indemnity
condition. I knew that while I was living in prison I had to become a sacrificial offering. This is why I
took on the most difficult tasks while I was there. (047-190, 1971/08/28)

2. After the liberation of Korea, I began to propagate the Word in North Korea, even though it was
overflowing with my enemies. I started on that path in prison. When I went to Pyongyang Prison, I knew
that I would not die. I even knew whom I would meet there. When I needed something, the spirit world
would sometimes instruct other prisoners -- for instance, ignorant thieves, robbers or murderers -- that in a
certain prison cell there was an inmate with number 596, and they should bring a certain thing to that
person. When it became winter and the weather grew cold, and I had no clothes to put on, they were
instructed to bring me clothes. And when I was really hungry because I had nothing to eat, the spirit
world sought out people who had never met me and, telling them my name and my number, compelled
them to bring me food. Such things happened, not once or twice but many times.  
Since I knew that there were people prepared for me to meet in Pyongyang Prison, where I remained until
May 20, 1948, I kept hope. It feels like only yesterday that I saw the willow leaves brushing against the
prison window. I can still recall it vividly. I met people there who had promised to follow God's Will.
With those meetings, the secret meetings of heaven began from the deepest valley in the land of the
enemy. From there, I started to recruit heaven's soldiers. Since I was cornered and driven away by the
families and the society, I had to start my work in this way from prison. (022-129, 1969/02/02)

3. My transfer in shackles from Pyongyang Prison to Hungnam Prison took 17 hours. What do you think
was on my mind as I rode in that vehicle? I felt so miserable, thinking of God who would have to see me
in this situation. He had no one but me to restore through indemnity the 6,0 00 years of His providence,
yet I ended up in this kind of situation. I was the only one who knew what should be done for God. Can
you imagine how serious I must have been as I looked at the fields and mountains through the window?
At the time, I was shackled in the vehicle together with a violent thief. As I sat there, I wondered with
deepest seriousness, "How can I survive in these circumstances?" (221-068, 1991/10/23)

4. I spent two years and eight months in Pyongyang Prison and Hungnam Prison in North Korea. This
corresponded to the three years of Jesus' public life. While there, I was able to restore more than 12
people. By doing so, I restored all the conditions that Jesus had lost. Even though most of them did not
follow me to the end, when I was freed from prison I put other people in their positions. Since I had
completed all that I had planned to do, heaven directed the United States, the archangel nation, and UN
troops to attack North Korea in order to liberate me. That was how I came out of prison. Four people
continued to follow me at the time. The UN troops protected South Korea. This set a global condition for
heavenly fortune to come back to the democratic world, and the work of restoring Christianity could be
launched. (052-185, 1971/12/29)

5. When Jesus was made to walk the path of death, the people of Israel and even his three beloved
disciples betrayed him. That is why, according to the principle of restoration through indemnity, when I
was in prison I had to restore the number 12 through indemnity, the same number as the 12 disciples that
Jesus had lost. Since I was in such a position, even though I did not witness at all while I was in Hungnam
Prison, people in the spirit world, who belonged to the realm of the Second Israel, witnessed to 12
inmates to follow me and fulfill that number. Such was the historical connection I experienced. Even
while I was under the strictest surveillance in prison by the communists, God took responsibility to
secretly organize people who united in heart with me. All this was unknown to anyone else. While there, I
could not witness openly. Yet, even when I stayed silent, the spirit world witnessed to people for me.

#### True Father prevails
While in Hungnam Prison, True Father went to sleep later than anyone else and woke up before
anyone else. At the labor site, for the sake of his fellow inmates he always volunteered for the
most difficult tasks. Because his lifestyle was so remarkable, True Father was nicknamed the
Saint of the Prison. Heaven could not but be moved by his absolutely sacrificial heart. In this
way, he set all the conditions necessary for the providence of restoration through indemnity.  
After the UN troops landed in Hungnam on October 12, 1950, the North Korean army began
executing prisoners. True Fathers execution was scheduled to take place on October 14, but on
that very day UN troops launched a full-scale attack and the North Korean army retreated. This
enabled True Father and all the remaining prisoners to be freed. Right after he came out of
prison, True Father set out for Pyongyang on foot, arriving there ten days later.

6. October 14 is the day I came out of Hungnam Prison. Can you imagine how miserable I must have felt
when I entered that prison? I had to survive it by all means. To survive, I had to go through a course in
which I was willing to die. We did forced, hard labor, but even so I became the prison's model worker.
That was the secret of my survival. There were not just dozens of workers, rather there were close to
1,000 workers there. Even from among that number the jailors chose me as the worker with the best
results. Do you think that was easy to accomplish? That is how I survived. By taking this kind of path, I
was able to proceed toward the fulfillment of the Will.  
Where is the leader who will overcome the obstacles of restoration, filled with bitter sorrow? I took
responsibility to digest everything -- the sorrows of the people, God's bitter grief resulting from the
failures of world Christianity, and all the difficulties related to those. As God's co-worker, I stood on His
side and recreated my path. I organized the ideal Christian cultural sphere that could resonate with my
mission from God. (220-078, 1991/10/14)

7. I was the champion laborer at the fertilizer factory in Hungnam. Because of that, all the prisoners
followed me around. Every morning, the guards organized us into teams for work. We were not allowed
to work with the same people every day. So, when the time came to organize teams, if, for instance, I had
gone to the toilet, others waited for me to come back and then lined up behind me. In this situation, all the
best workers ended up joining my team and I became their leader.  
I made a science out of how to tie a bag, carry it, and load it onto the train. I designed the most efficient
method to accomplish these tasks. Therefore, when I worked I did not have to think about what I was
doing, but was freed to think of other things. I was making plans for the future, thinking about the nation
and the world. While I formulated such plans, I often lost track of time and the working hours flew by.
Consequently, even though I was sweating as much as the others, I did not feel exhausted. Working in
this way was mentally empowering. Every time they gave out the awards, I received the award for being
the model worker. This is how I survived there. (222-295, 1991/11/03)

8. On August 1, 1950, during the Korean War, American B-29 bombers launched an all-out attack on
Hungnam. I knew this would happen. I foresaw it. Additionally, I knew that God would protect me,
providing a circle of safety 12 meters around me during the attack. I told those who were close to me to
stay near me. As the bombs were falling, I meditated silently. I was not thinking of the bombing but was
rather thinking about the ideal world in the future.  
Ultimately, the most worthy people are those with a clear vision of the ideal. If a person is carrying out a
mission of providential restoration, sending that person to the spirit world would be a loss for God and for
the cosmos. So, God desired to protect me at any cost, and in fact He had no choice but to do so. (035-
189, 1970/10/13)

9. A few days before the UN bombers attacked, the communists began to lead some of the prisoners
away. One day they started to collect hemp strings, such as are used for corpses. I intuitively felt that
some kind of final reckoning was imminent. I offered a very serious prayer. The guards called the
prisoners one by one and explained that they would be transferred to another place. The prisoners did not
realize it, but I knew it was their final call. They threw each of the prisoners upside down into a well,
killing them. The next day it would have been my turn, but that very night, at 2:00 a.m., the UN troops
launched an all-out attack, and it was thanks to them that I was able to leave Hungnam Prison alive. (035-
189, 1970/10/13)

10. The UN troops bombed North Korea in 1950. The first place they bombed was the Hungnam area.
The place they bombed was very close to Hungnam Prison where I was being held at the time. Thanks to
those UN troops, I was able to walk out of prison. There are many behind-the-scenes stories of how this
came about. From Hungnam, which is located on the east coast, I returned to Pyongyang on foot. I walked
from the shores of the East Sea all the way to Pyongyang, which is situated in the west. Once I arrived in
Pyongyang, I informed every person who had followed me previously that I had returned. I searched for
all my disciples. Even though most of them did not come back, I was able to gather a few people together.
(052-156, 1971/12/27)

11. I was set free on October 14, 1950, and, after following the coast of the East Sea for a short distance, I
walked to Pyongyang, accompanied by four followers who had been in the labor camp with me. When we
reached the border between North and South Pyeongan Provinces, we discovered that the North Korean
soldiers who were fleeing over the mountain passes were executing anyone whom they believed harbored
defiant thoughts towards communism. Our path brought us directly through just such a mountain pass.
Dozens of people were being lined up and killed. But we were not in our prison uniforms, so the North
Korean soldiers did not recognize us as the enemy. Four times during that journey we faced such life-and-
death situations. (549-208, 2006/12/26)
