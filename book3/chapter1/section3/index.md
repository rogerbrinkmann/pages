## Chapter 1 True Father Begins His Course of Public Life

### Section 3 Eight-Stage Restoration and 43-Day Battle for Victory

#### Vertical restoration
True Father was supposed to meet a woman in the position of perfected Eve on the foundation of
having received the blessing from Rev. Kim Baek-moon. The woman was the elderly Mrs. Pak
Eul-yong, the self-proclaimed "Wife of Jehovah." At the time, she was in a position where God
guided her and the spirit world followed her. Therefore, True Father went to look for Mrs. Pak in
order to restore and take back the right of dominion from Eve.  
He served her from the lowest possible position, even looking after her children for her, walking
the path of sacrifice and service. This woman testified to True Father as he passed through each
one of the different stages of servant of servants, servant, adopted son, stepson, son, prime
minister of the heavenly kingdom, the position of Jesus, and the substantial object partner of God.
In this way, having searched for and established all positions of the vertical eight stages, he
concluded the work of restoration to regain the right of dominion from Eve.

1. Having received the blessing of inheritance from a male representative, I also needed to receive it from
a female representative. Without this, restoration could not be accomplished. I had received the male
blessing from the group of Rev. Kim Baek-moon. The restoration of the blessing from a female
representative still remained to be completed. Without it, I could not inherit the entire providential
foundation that God had prepared in Korea.  
I left Rev. Kim after establishing the standard of receiving his blessing, and now I had to restore the same
thing through indemnity in order to receive the blessing from a woman. Since it was a woman who caused
the Fall, fundamental restoration must be done through a woman. This is why women had to go through
suffering courses until now. They had to go through hardships throughout the course of history in order to
open the gate to the positions of servant, adopted child, and son and daughter. (023-287, 1969/06/08)

2. I had heard a rumor that there was an eccentric elderly lady in Pyongyang. The spiritual people in the
area communicated well among themselves, and they all knew about her. That lady claimed she was the
wife of Jehovah. Secular people said she was crazy. Even Christian churches said she was crazy. But I
had been waiting for such a woman, and I was very happy to hear what they said about her. Upon hearing
about her, I prayed, "O, Heaven! For the fulfillment of the mission of restoration, You have prepared the
foundation of heavenly law for this Korean Peninsula. Through these women, Heo Ho-bin and Pak Eul-
yong, You have been preparing to resolve the matter of the Fall, which still remains. Therefore I will go
to Pyongyang." In my prayer I reported this to heaven.  
Since Christianity failed to attend this matter of the Will, that history must be restored through indemnity.
God guided and prepared everything for me. Even when I was crossing the 38th parallel, a rainbow
showed me the way forward. It directly guided me for 50 kilometers. By following this kind of amazing
guidance, I eventually visited Mrs. Pak in Pyongyang and concluded the restoration of that history
through indemnity. (023-284, 1969/06/08)

3. Even the Returning Lord must go through a process to receive blessings. He has to receive the blessing
as the world-level Abel. He should meet people who can bless him in this way, and then offer them
sincere devotion day and night so that they will feel no regret in passing all their blessings onto him. He
must receive their world-level blessing, which at the same time is heaven's blessing. He should be blessed
not only as Abel but also as the Messiah. In order to become the Returning Lord, he must receive the
blessing while standing in the position of the world-level Abel and the heir of the Messiah. But a son
cannot bless the Messiah. Only a mother can do so. The only ones who can give birth to the Messiah are a
mother and God. The Messiah is born through a woman, and for that reason only a mother and God can
bless him. Therefore, a woman who is also the wife of God must appear. She must appear and testify that
she can serve him as the Messiah. However, in order for the mother to give such a testimony saying, "You
are my beloved child," the candidate for the Messiah must give her absolute obedience. He has to advance
in such an environment. In order to receive that blessing, he must serve her in the role of a servant of
servants. (133-144, 1984/07/10)

4. When I received precious things from people who wanted to follow and attend me, I gave them all to
this elderly woman, Mrs. Pak, who was called the wife of Jehovah. Today our church members, in order
to restore the Korean people, are taking care of elderly men and women in rural areas and wiping the
runny noses of little children. But that is nothing compared to what I did in those days. I did everything
for Mrs. Pak, which included laundering her undergarments, something even other women were reluctant
to do. I needed to do whatever she told me to do, because that was the formula for the providence of
restoration. God's history of restoration through indemnity started from the position of a servant, and so I
myself needed to be treated as a servant in the beginning. When I offered my sincere devotion in the
position of a servant, I could restore that position.  
You do not know how exciting it was to have this kind of experience. This time was like a testing period
leading up to the point where I could proclaim, "Ah! This is how the Principle works." It was a time
period to test whether or not the Principle was true. Because I had such an attitude and practiced it,
heaven was sure to give me the blessing. I began restoring the blessing, starting from the position of
servant of servants. After I was recognized as the best servant of servants, I went up to the position of a
servant. Likewise, with further devotion, I received the blessing in the position of an adopted son. (023-
286, 1969/06/08)

5. I heard a rumor that there was an elderly woman who said she was the wife of Jehovah, so I went to
look for her. I visited her and discovered that she was living such a spiritual life that she would dance
with the saints and the sages who lived in the spirit world. Jesus would come to her and give lectures.
Confucius and Moses would come to her and speak with her. I joined them, and in the beginning I entered
the position of a servant to the archangel. All the people there said that a servant of servants who is loved
by heaven had come to them. Then they realized I was superior to the other servants of servants, so they
said, "Wow! Now, you are a servant." That was how they testified about me. Then they said, "You are the
younger brother of Jesus," and then later, "You are Jesus' twin brother." This is restoration. With each
new statement from them, I continued to be elevated, "You are the elder brother of Jesus," and then, "You
are the prime minister of the heavenly kingdom." The position above the prime minister is God. I was
then the prime minister of the heavenly kingdom, so they said, "You are the king of the heavenly
kingdom!" But to be the king was not enough. "You are the teacher of teachers who teaches us about the
spirit world, and you are the father of fathers. At the same time, you are the king." In this way, Mrs. Pak
stood in God's place and acknowledged my progress. Finally, after I had started by serving Mrs. Pak from
the position of a servant of servants, our positions were completely reversed. (438-292, 2004/02/18)

#### 43-day course in the spirit world
After finding and establishing the positions of the vertical eight stages, True Father had to endure
43 days of trials sent by the spirit world. The situation was such that Jesus and all the saints and
sages in the spirit world refuted True Father's word of the Principle. Armed with the laws of
heaven, Father faced all their opposition by himself and fought them to the end. God ultimately
declared that True Father's assertions were indeed the principles, secret truths and laws by
which the work of restoration can be completed. Then God bestowed His Divine Seal on True
Father.

6. After I received the blessing from Mrs. Pak, I told her who I was. I told her what kind of mission she
had, and that she needed to submit herself to God's Will that seeks to resolve the bitter sorrows of
restoration. She had to hear all that from a young man whom previously she had been able to control as
she wished. She must have been very shocked to hear that she now had to submit to me, especially since
in those days, she was considered to be the wife of Jehovah. If she had followed me at that time, I would
not have gone on to suffer such hardships. She was supposed to yield to me, but it was too hard for her to
do so. With that failure, about 1,000 people were disconnected from the providence. The moment she
went against me, rather than yielding to me, she became mentally ill.  
Until I came to inherit internal and external blessings, the spiritual test I had to go through was beyond
description. It was the test of the 43-day course. During that period, all the spirits in the spirit world raged
against me. However, I fought against them with heaven's principle. For 43 days, I fought against the
entire spirit world including all the religious leaders, Jesus, and even God. God could not allow the spirit
world to turn into a battleground. He had to declare the verdict, but did so only after 43 days had passed.
Without heaven's principle, the heavens and the earth will perish. The path I had found could not be
wrong. In the end, I received the ruling from heaven that I had won the final battle in the spirit world.
(008-229, 1960/01/06)

7. What was it that the Returning Lord had to accomplish? Due to the opposition of Christianity, the
entire foundation in the spiritual world and the physical world that had been laid for my victory had
completely collapsed. Therefore, I had to rebuild it. All of the 4,000-year history of the providence of
restoration on the levels of the individual, family, tribe, people and nation had to be reorganized in the
spirit world. That is why I entered the spirit world and fought against numerous people there. The spirit
world was against me. They were on Satan's side, opposing me and accusing me of being a heretic.  
Restoration through indemnity is inevitable. I had to deal with it first as an individual. We had ideological
disputes over the truth. I could not build the kingdom of heaven on earth just with my fists. I had to win
the fight with truth and true love. Consequently, there was great chaos in the spirit world for 43 days.
People did not know that the religious leaders had failed to fulfill their portions of responsibility, or that
the process of restoration is accomplished through changing the bloodline centering on the heart. Through
my proclamation of such truth, the spirit world is now aware of these things. They disputed with me, and
they lost. (261-123, 1994/06/09)

8. In order to become the Lord at the Second Advent, I had to enter the spirit world and obtain God's
Divine Seal. I entered the spirit world and fought there for 43 days. From the bottom of hell to the top of
heaven, the whole spirit world said, "Moon is a heretic." I had to bring order in such a situation, starting
from the bottom. In the end, I had to fight the saints and sages, and even God, regarding who was the
rightful owner of the providence. At that time I said, "All the people in the spirit world are from the
wrong bloodline. Did you know that you must change your lineage?" The second issue was the restoration
of the authority of possession. I said, "Anyone who had their own right of possession on earth is a traitor
to the heavenly kingdom!" The religious founders considered themselves very distinguished, but this
became their stumbling block. That was why in the spirit world I took a firm stand and fought with full
confidence, saying, "How can this be heresy?"  
Toward the end, when it seemed that great chaos might break out in the spirit world, even God, the
presiding Judge with the power to declare the verdict, opposed me. Further, it was in accord with the
principle of restoration through indemnity that since Adam betrayed God, God also had to betray the
perfected Adam. Only then could the sorrowful walls in God's heart be torn down. Therefore, the whole
spirit world and even God opposed me, leaving me to stand alone. Still, God could not leave the spirit
world in such a state, and had to declare the final verdict. He said that what I had said about restoring the
heavenly bloodline, the authority of possession, and the realm of the heavenly heart was all true. I
received God's Divine Seal as the victor and returned to earth. (264-050, 1994/10/09)

9. Immediately after liberation, Korea and all its Christian churches, which are components of the free
world, united to oppose me. Just as in the past, when the government and the religious authorities united
to kill Jesus and John the Baptist, similar things happened in Korea. Satan killed Adam and destroyed
Adam's family, and he killed Jesus, postponing the development of the Christian cultural sphere.
Likewise, now that we had come to the worldwide level, he mobilized all his might to attack me on the
physical plane. That physical attack was fearful, but Satan even attacked me spiritually. Satan launched
attacks from both the spiritual and physical worlds.  
God said to Satan, "Do whatever you want to do! Do everything you want to do!" What Satan wanted to
do was to challenge me to find out if I was qualified to be the Father of the entire spirit world and
physical world combined. Satan said, "I have established my foundation through my descendants in the
world and in the spirit world. You claim to be the True Parent who has come to earth in order to liberate
humankind from this, but I will not recognize you as the True Parent unless you first overcome all the
challenges from the spirit world as well as from the physical world." From the Principle perspective, God
had to accept what Satan said. Knowing this, before I faced the attack of the entire world, I first went to
the spirit world in order to unite its many levels. (268-279, 1995/04/03)

10. Adam betrayed God, and that needed to be restored through indemnity. The principle of restoration
through indemnity is merciless; there is no forgiveness. Since Adam betrayed God, in the Last Days, in
order for the Lord of the Second Advent to appear, Adam's betrayal has to be restored through indemnity.
That is why God could not express His love for me, but instead had to strike me. Under such
circumstances God opposed me, but I fought back, insisting that what I said was true. God could not leave
the spirit world in never-ending chaos, so He had to proclaim the victor within 43 days. I had to come
back from the spirit world with His Divine Seal testifying to my victory through such a proclamation.
God is the root of everything, and after receiving God's Divine Seal for having made the complete
foundation for victory, I came down from the spirit world to the earth. In this way, I resolved all the
disputes in the spirit world that had been going on for 4,000 years. (261-124, 1994/06/09)

11. I never complained even during hardships. Even amid persecution, I did not complain. Nations,
communities, families and individuals in the spirit world continually attacked me until the end of my 43-
day course, but they could not defeat me. They were all defeated. Later, even God struck me. However,
no matter how God treated me, I held onto God. Since God opposed me, Jesus, Confucius, Buddha,
Mohammed, and the whole spirit world opposed me. However, during those 43 days I never yielded.
Finally after 43 days, God had to reach a verdict. That is why God proclaimed me as the greatest victor in
heaven and on earth. (161-041, 1987/01/01)
