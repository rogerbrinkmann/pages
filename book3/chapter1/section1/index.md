## Chapter 1 True Father Begins His Course of Public Life

### Section 1  Father's Public Course

#### God's victory in World War II
The foundation for the providence centered on the Lord at the Second Advent was established
through the victory of God's side in World War II centered on Christianity. The liberation of
Korea on August 15, 1945, ended 40 years of Japanese colonial rule. This was a singularly
notable event in the history of God's providence. When Korea was finally freed from Japanese
colonialism, it became possible for the providence to advance to a new level.
1. World War II was a war in which England, America and France united and fought against Japan,
Germany and Italy. What was sown at the Fall had to be harvested. The seed that began with individuals
bore fruit in nations on the world level. Fallen seeds were sown by Adam and Eve and then divided into
Cain and Abel. Hence, the world was divided into two: the God's side Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel, and the
Satan's side Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel. England was Eve on God's side, America was Abel on God's
side, and France was Cain on God's side. On Satan's side, Japan was Eve, Germany was Abel and Italy
was Cain. In World War II, God's side and Satan's side fought each other, and Satan's side was defeated.
(189-212, 1989/04/06)
2. During the First and Second World Wars, Korea was under Japanese rule and Korean patriots fought
against Japanese imperialism. Korea suffered under Japanese rule for 40 years. During those 40 years,
Japan attempted to erase the Korean traditional culture, and even the Korean language.
Due to the Fall of the first human ancestors, God lost the four-position foundation. Therefore, God's
purpose for the providence of restoration was to restore the four-position foundation. This is why the
number four appears so often in God's providence as depicted in the Bible. There are many indemnity
periods of 40 and 400 years in the Bible. Restoration through indemnity is always achieved by this
principle.
For Korea to become the Adam nation in God's providence, it first had to be ruled by an Eve nation. And
then Korea had to overcome that Eve nation and achieve independence. During that time, Japan united
with Germany and Italy. These countries were on Satan's side. Japan was the Eve nation on Satan's side.
The United States, Britain and France were on God's side. During World War I, Germany was almost
completely destroyed. Twenty years later, Germany had revived, and had a providential role during
World War II.
The country that strikes another country first is always defeated. This is why the United States, England
and France joined forces and together defeated the nations on Satan's side.
Korea had to live under Japanese rule for a period of 40 years. Japan was the Eve nation on Satan's side.
During that time, Japan tried to get rid of Korea's traditional culture and even the Korean language. (052-
138, 1971/12/27)
3. While under Satan's dominion, first the nation of Israel and then Christianity fought against Satan
physically and spiritually. Likewise, while the land of Korea was dominated by its enemy Japan for 40
years, Korean patriots who were internally determined to die for the nation led an independence
movement. Centered on such a spirit, God continued to expand His investment in the providence. Those
patriots worked together in unity and established a nation centered on those who believed in Christianity.
It was extremely significant for the providence that Christians who loved Korea at the risk of their lives
established a patriotic standard while the nation was under 40 years of Japanese occupation. (071-230,
1974/05/01)
4. After the liberation of Korea, a new providential movement could have been launched centered on
America. On the foundation of a worldwide victory centered on Christianity and America, God's
providence could have begun a new era. Because Father knew the new level of truth, the Principle, he had
been active in the Korean underground independence movement. With the liberation of Korea, the time
had come when Father could work publicly.
At that time, the United States military stationed in Korea set up a government administration. Many
Koreans who worked for the US military administration were those who had come home from their
studies overseas. These people could easily unite with the military administration. Those Korean
Christians that had been informants for the Japanese government, worshipping at Shinto shrines, also had
connections with the US military administration.
On the other hand, Christians who had been active in the underground were members of locally rooted
groups and were not used to relating with people from foreign countries. Therefore, they were not able to
form relationships with the office of the US administration. Hence, in the end the Korean Christians
divided into two groups: those who had cooperated with the Japanese and those who had opposed them.
(161-069, 1987/01/02)
5. The purpose of religion is the perfection of Adam. The purpose of God's restoration providence is also
the perfection of Adam. During the Creation, the archangel helped God in the Garden of Eden for the sake
of Adam's perfection. God created angels as His helpers and supporters. God's purpose and the angels'
purpose were the same: the perfection of Adam.
Therefore, the standard of perfection must be indemnified at the world level, in the spiritual world and in
the physical world. Christianity is the religion of the archangelic realm on God's side. The environment
created immediately after World War II was one in which Christianity was able to move the world. The
whole world moved toward heaven's side. Adam would certainly appear at such a time.
Satan's world and the archangelic realm on God's side had fought both spiritually and physically. In a
biblical sense, this was the war of Armageddon. The victory of God's side in World War II meant that
heaven's archangelic realm in the spiritual world and in the physical world defeated Satan's world. Hence,
the time had come when Adam could appear on earth. This is why I am saying that right after World War
II was the time when the Second Coming of Christ could occur. (122-094, 1982/11/01)
6. When World War II was ending, Japanese oppression made it difficult for devoted Christians to keep
their faith. Koreans prayed to God for decisive action in Korea, and many people were directly guided by
God or by the spirit world. They were able to escape from or evade arrest by the Japanese police. Most of
them knew Japan would be defeated. Many people in Korea received revelations that after World War II
world history would unfold centered on Korea.
I was connected with several groups of such people. But I could not reveal anything of the Principle that
you are now learning. I could not tell them, because I received instructions from God and promised God
that I would start my work only after the liberation of Korea, when the proper conditions had been set.
God's Will cannot be achieved by only one man. There must be people willing to work with that man.
God also revealed that after World War II the Christian churches would be divided. (052-139,
1971/12/27)
7. Right after the liberation of Korea in 1945, if Korean Christianity had united with the Unification
movement and with me, then, based on the Christian cultural sphere, the work of uniting the entire world
could have begun immediately. Then, from such a position, the providence easily could have expanded
beyond the national level. At that time, Korea did not control its own sovereignty, but had inherited the
foundation of the adopted son based upon the foundation of the victorious realm of America, the
archangel nation, centering on the Christian cultural sphere. On this foundation, had the Unification
movement established a worldwide foundation, the angelic world and the adopted son's world could have
reached perfection and could have entered the era of the world cultural sphere that would have received
the Son and Daughter of God's direct lineage. If the realm of the Abel culture centered on the returning
Christ had been realized, the realms of the archangel and adopted son could have been connected to the
realm of the True Son. Thus history, as a vertical line, is to become one with the horizontal reality. Unless
I can manage to forge this unity, it will not be possible to remove Satan's base. (131-045, 1984/04/01)
8. If I had been able to establish a foundation centered on Christianity before the August 15 liberation of
Korea, the Jaegeon Christian group -- those who were imprisoned for refusing to worship at Shinto
shrines -- could have taken a central position based on my foundation of faith.
If that had happened, Christianity could have followed my guidance and stood in the position to welcome
the United Nations troops. The UN troops would then have been welcomed by those who had been
imprisoned, and the whole world could have been connected. If the UN had been welcomed in North
Korea at that time, Korea would not have been divided into North and South. If the spiritual groups had
been united in welcoming the UN troops, there would have been no place for Satan to invade. However,
this ideal vision was not realized. Therefore, I had to restore this by making other conditions.
In particular, Rev. Heo Ho-bin's spiritual group did not receive me. In a lonely place, I had to send
messages more than three times. After I reported to heaven, I made it clear to them, "Unless you accept
my guidance, your nation and the world will be destroyed and all the merit you have built up will be taken
away by heaven." By giving them this warning, I laid a foundation that I could harvest later. Then I
waited for the liberation of Korea. After Korea was liberated, I had to travel around the world. (134-076,
1985/01/04)
9. I grew up during the time of Japanese occupation. Under the circumstances of that time, even though I
had a great vision and hope in my heart, I could not express what I had in my mind. Even when I had
extraordinary thoughts, I could not express them without being circumspect and checking whether
speaking was appropriate. However great the thought or idea I may have had, it was not the time when I
could express myself unless I felt clearly it was safe to do so. In other words, it was a time of restrictions.
Under these circumstances, I prepared myself and fought to feel my way forward in the course of
restoration. I had to take the path revealed in the Principle, which nobody knew.
Then in 1945, Korea was liberated. I was 25 years old. All the Korean people were happy as they
celebrated their liberation. In an uproar they shouted, Mansei! They were filled with joy as if all of heaven
and earth was theirs and they could turn the world upside down. I was happy as well. However, except for
that day, I have not shouted Mansei for the liberation of the nation. Even though I was happy, I could not
be truly happy. This was because I knew the Korean people were responsible for making a new start, and
I myself had to make a historical new start as well, and make the first step toward world restoration. Since
I was in South Korea at that time, I invested all my heart in pioneering the path of restoration centered on
Seoul. (157-071, 1967/02/14) 

#### Christian disbelief 
The liberation of Korea came at a turning point in world history. In 1945, an opportune moment
had come in the providence of restoration to establish heaven's sovereignty and restore the world
centered on Christianity. However, Christianity did not accept Father, the very person leading
this providence. Father was then faced with the difficulty of having to prepare a new providential
foundation.
After his first attempt to begin the providence, focusing on Seoul, was frustrated, he put into
motion his second attempt at the providence, focusing on Pyongyang, beginning in June, 1946.
However, all the providential foundations that God had prepared collapsed in failure, and Father
was forced to walk the path of suffering in prison. Among the many Christian denominations in
Korea, there were some that had given in to Japan's coercion and had worshipped at Shinto
shrines. There were other patriotic believers who had remained underground and had fought the
Japanese, keeping true to their faith while waiting for the day of liberation.
Under such circumstances, spiritual groups that had actively worked for the 14 years before
Korea was liberated were laying foundations to receive the Lord at the Second Advent. In
particular, men from Wonsan were doing spiritual works in the eastern part of Korea. At the
same time, women appeared who were doing spiritual works in Cheolsan, in the western part.
Among these women, the most notable were Rev. Kim Seong-do of the Holy Lord Church, Rev.
Heo Ho-bin of the Inside the Womb Church, and the elderly Mrs. Pak Eul-yong, who was called
"the Wife of Jehovah." The most notable men were Rev. Yi Yong-do and Rev. Kim Baek-moon of
the New Jesus Church. Rev. Kim Baek-moon, in particular, was entrusted with the mission of
John the Baptist. He testified that Father was going to achieve the worldwide glory of King
Solomon. But he did not serve or follow Father, so the providence could not begin at that time.
10. The democratic world centered on global Christianity is the realm of the Second Israel. Christianity is
in the position to offer a worldview to guide the democratic world. This is similar to the position of
Judaism in the First Israel. Israel and Christianity are thus spiritually connected. Therefore, the work of
the Lord at his Second Coming must be done upon the victorious foundation through which he can inherit
the realm of the spiritual Israel. He must appear on earth upon the victorious foundation on the spiritual
individual level, the spiritual family level, and the spiritual tribe, spiritual people, spiritual nation, and
spiritual world levels. The Lord at the Second Advent cannot put the world in order without having such
foundations.
After subjugating the entire spirit world and taking control of it, he reigns over the world following God's
Will. After that, he needs to go through the substantial indemnity course, this time on earth. Spiritually,
the realm of the Second Israel was victorious worldwide. This worldwide realm of Israel, which won
spiritual victory, corresponds on the world level to the angelic world. Since the Returning Lord is the
Third Adam, he has to inherit the foothold of the realm of the spiritual Israel which the Second Adam,
Jesus, had won. (038-099, 1971/01/03)
11. After its liberation from Japan, Korea was supposed to have been established as a republic in the
context of a united world, protected by the democratic world of the Christian realm. At that time, I
expected to start at the highest level, fulfilling a new historical mission by joining hands with the leaders
of the newborn country. However, things were interrupted when some pastors representing Christianity
opposed me. A nation built around Christianity could have been formed, but the top leaders of
Christianity opposed me, and that led all of Christianity in Korea to oppose me. (067-248, 1973/07/01)
12. In the effort to annihilate Christianity in Korea, Japanese imperialists forced Christians to worship at
Shinto shrines. There were two types of Christian groups at that time: those who accepted worship at
Shinto shrines and those who rejected it. Those who rejected it were imprisoned or went underground.
Those who accepted worship at the shrines became prominent in society. At that time, the spiritual groups
who went underground received revelations that the Messiah would come in the flesh and lead their
groups, though they did not know who he was. Therefore, they were in the subject position to educate the
Christians who were prominent in society. These groups could have united and taken the role of the
leading people when Korea gained its independence.
After the liberation of Korea, the underground spiritual groups were supposed to have taken the subject
position. But the opposite happened. Those who worshipped at the Shinto shrines and those who had
studied abroad and had contacts in America took the subject position. A Christian revival movement
could have been initiated under the ideal of the Returning Lord and based on the Returning Lords new
understanding of God, but that chance was lost.
Around the time of the liberation of Korea, most Korean churches were in North Korea. Since the
majority of churches were in Pyongyang, it meant North Korea was the center of Korean Christianity.
Therefore, the Christian movement in North Korea could have established the framework of the nation
and become the spiritual foundation of providential activities to revive worldwide Christianity. However,
it failed to do so. Instead, when the nation was formed, Christians fought among themselves like Cain and
Abel. Before the churches could establish the proper foundation, Satan invaded, and the Cain nation was
established first.
In this situation, a new nation needed to be established to at least protect the southern part of Korea. This
is why Korea could not be unified. It was divided into two nations. Korea could have become a unified
nation with Christianity at the center and become the base for God's Will. Instead, it began to fall into
Satan's hands. (146-118, 1986/06/08)
13. After the liberation of Korea, three groups of Christian churches appeared: those that worshipped at
the Shinto shrines; the Jaegeon group who took it as their mission to rebuild the church and whose
members chose to go to prison rather than obey orders to worship at the Shinto shrines; and the Spirit-led
churches. In terms of the Principle, the first group was the formation stage, the second was the growth
stage and the third was the completion stage.
The group of Spirit-led churches took on the mission to restore the Garden of Eden. This group consisted
of three churches. Their respective leaders were: Rev. Pak Dong-gi, representing the Old Testament Age;
Rev. Kim Baek-moon, representing New Testament Age; and Rev. Heo Ho-bin, representing the
Completed Testament Age. Rev. Heo's church was led by women.
These groups were to restore the formation, growth and completion stages vertically and restore the Old,
New and Completed Testament Ages horizontally. The group of churches that worked to restore the
church and the group of Spirit-led churches were to have united together, and I was meant to stand on
their foundation. However, just as John the Baptist did not support Jesus, the leaders of these Spirit-led
churches could not recognize who I was, even though they knew that the Lord would come again as a
person in the flesh. (165-020, 1987/05/19)
14. Rev. Kim Seong-do had the mission of Eve, and Rev. Heo Ho-bin had that of Mother Mary. Jesus
came to earth and lived 33 years. His life ended by execution on the cross without being able to complete
his mission. Therefore, Rev. Heo's group prepared everything to indemnify that. She prophesied that the
Messiah at his Second Coming would come to Korea. She even received revelations about the height and
build of the Messiah and prepared clothing, bedding and everything else for him.
She received that originally all these things were to have been prepared for Jesus at his coming, and that if
there were nobody to prepare them for the Returning Lord, God could not send him. In the past, not even
one room was prepared for Jesus to lie down in. Consequently, he was laid in a manger. Since God felt
bitter sorrow over this, God selected one person and had her prepare everything needed for the Messiah's
daily life, including his clothing, his room and so on. God had her prepare everything of the best quality,
things that would be considered the best by anyone, whether in the East or the West. (008-224,
1960/01/06)
15. On the eastern coast of Korea, Rev. Yi Yong-do was a leader of one of the Spirit-led churches. He
ignited the fire of the Holy Spirit in many people. Through such spiritual work, heaven tried to unite all
the spiritual figures into one group. The spiritual work was divided into two categories: one was internal
and the other was external. Rev. Yi established a church called the New Jesus Church. At that time, the
Inside the Womb Church in western Korea received a revelation instructing its members to unite with the
New Jesus Church. So they visited the New Jesus Church in the east, but the eastern group did not accept
the western group. Because they did not unite, God needed a pioneer for a new movement.
God wanted to find another person who could accept His direction. That person was Rev. Kim Baekmoon. Rev. Baek Nam-ju was the formation stage, Rev. Yi was the growth stage, and Rev. Kim was the
completion stage. Rev. Yi was in the position of Jesus. He died in 1933 at the age of 33. From this, we
can understand that God made extensive preparations in this way for the Second Coming of the Lord. God
started these early preparations so that Korea would be able to overcome Japanese oppression. Under
these circumstances, I started to prepare for my own course. (052-148, 1971/12/27)
16. When I was around 25 years old, I met all the famous religious people in Korea, including Christian
pastors, Buddhist monks, astrologers and spiritualists. I used to debate with them on views of faith,
comparing what they knew and what I knew. When I asked Christian ministers, "What was the Fall?"
none of them knew. They did not know how humanity fell. Although Christianity had made amazing
progress and had achieved world-level results, if its leaders were unclear about what happened at the start
of human history, they would not be able to reach perfection. Yet these pastors were all completely
unaware of the cause of the Fall. Nevertheless, although I knew how the Fall took place and all of its
circumstances, all the so-called knowledgeable people whom I met did not know about it. Still, the time
was not ripe, so I could not make it known. (211-135, 1990/12/30)
17. As I grew up from childhood to adolescence and became more mature, I deeply researched the
contents of the Bible. I came to understand everything about God's providence. Then at age 26, with the
liberation of Korea, I made a new start. I had begun visiting underground churches at the age of 24, before
Korea was liberated. I was thinking, "What kind of path do these spiritual people take? God's providence
should go this way, and certain groups must be prepared for this purpose." With this in mind, I met many
prominent spiritual people. But they did not know God's Will and its direction.
Therefore, I began preaching with all my heart, and I made relationships with them. I visited underground
churches, and even though the leaders did not recognize me, the people in those churches who
communicated with the spirit world testified to me. When I stayed there just one week, the spiritual
people there followed me. Such phenomena occurred. That divided the underground church into two
groups. I had to gather people who understood me in order to form a spiritual church. I had to teach them
that the Messiah was not coming on the clouds. I knew that many Christians would join me if I kept that
truth sealed for about ten years. But heaven did not allow me to do so. God's providence required a frontal
assault. God is invisible, so I needed to be His visible instrument to cope with and overcome the world
dominated by the invisible Satan. (211-142, 1990/12/30)
18. I met Rev. Kim Baek-moon in October 1945, three months after the liberation of Korea. I knew he
had a great mission. In those days, he was the leader of the Christian Israel Monastery, which he had
founded at heaven's direction. He knew he needed to prepare a foundation to receive the Lord at the
Second Advent. It was the direction heaven had given him. I visited his group and stayed there for six
months. During that period, God worked through various means. (052-150, 1971/12/27)
19. I went to Rev. Kim Baek-moon's group and attended him as a servant. You cannot even imagine how
many tears I shed at that time. I prayed with a sincerity that people could not fathom. The wooden floor
on which I prayed was always wet with my tears. I could have criticized the contents of Rev. Kim's
teaching. I could have fully subjugated him and his followers by speaking out about the revelation I
received. But instead, I continued serving them without saying anything. As a result of this, God was with
me, and since they were also spiritually pure, God gave them the direction to follow me. (023-283,
1969/06/08)
20. Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. Similarly, it was ordained that I was to inherit everything
from Rev. Kim Baek-moon. After six months, Rev. Kim received a revelation from heaven, and he put his
hand on my head and blessed me, saying, "May all the glory of King Solomon from throughout the world
be on you." My encounter with Rev. Kim was significant in the providence. At that point, since heaven
told him to bless me, he should have asked me and found out why I was given such a blessing. This was
his five percent portion of responsibility. However, as his devoted followers started to follow me, he was
displeased. Regardless, I received the blessing from him, through which I inherited what he had. (052-
150, 1971/12/27)
21. After the liberation of Korea, I wanted to make my providential start with Rev. Kim Baek-moon. Rev.
Kim and I were in the positions of Cain and Abel, or John the Baptist and Jesus. He was a Christian, and
he said Jesus was of the same rank as God. He did not know the fundamental truth, but spiritually he
certainly had the highest level of Christian faith at that time. Because Rev. Kim's chief disciples and other
followers were communicating with the spirit world, the spirit world told them to follow me. But I did not
say a word, because I could not destroy another person's foundation after entering it. I needed them to
submit to me voluntarily. So I shed many tears and stayed there in silence as an exemplary member of the
church. When the church members decided to follow me, problems occurred. (038-060, 1971/01/01)
