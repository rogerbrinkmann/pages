## Chapter 2. True Father's Journey to South Korea and His Course in Busan

### Section 1.  Journey to the South

#### Father's disciples
From February 22, 1948, until October 14, 1950, True Father persevered and prevailed, first
enduring severe torture at the Pyongyang Internal Affairs Bureau and Pyongyang Prison, and
then overcoming cruel forced labor at the Hungnam Special Labor Camp. As he persevered in his
course of indemnity, at times he was close to death. After leaving Hungnam Prison, True Father
went to Pyongyang in order to meet and care for his members. Many of the residents had already
fled to the South.  
Forty days after his arrival, on the night of December 4, True Father, together with Kim Won-pil,
a representative of Christianity in the position of the bride, and Pak Jeong-hwa, the
representative of his disciples in prison in the position of the archangel, set out for South Korea.
They crossed the Daedong River by boat at Hanggae, downstream from Manggyongdae. Because
Pak Jeong-hwa was injured, True Father pushed him on a bicycle.  
When they reached Byokseong-gun in Hwanghae Province, they passed through Yongmae Island
in the southern part of the Cheongryong Peninsula to reach the Imjin River. Crossing that frozen
river, they finally entered South Korean territory. True Fathers difficult path guiding his two
disciples to the South from Pyongyang symbolizes one aspect of the providence, that heaven
guides humanity from the fallen world to the ideal world of the original creation.

1. After I was released from Hungnam Prison, I went to Pyongyang. I could have visited my hometown
where my parents were, but I did not. I thought that before I went to my hometown, I should first know
the whereabouts and condition of the members who had followed me before I went to prison. I had to take
care of them. That is heaven's way. In the meantime, the war situation changed and I was not able to go to
my hometown. Nonetheless, I had foreseen that this might happen. It was all the more reason that I
hurried to visit my members rather than first going to visit my hometown. With this in mind, when we
crossed the 38th parallel I prayed, "It is for heaven that I leave for South Korea without going to my
hometown. When I return, I will liberate North Korea and visit my hometown to celebrate the victory of
heaven." My whole life I have been fighting in order that one day I could fulfill this prayer. (125-295,
1983/03/29)

2. What did I do when I returned to Pyongyang after leaving Hungnam Prison? I wanted to find the
members who had followed me before my imprisonment. I met them one by one. Among the last three I
tried to visit, two had already died of old age. There was one person in particular whom I wanted to meet.
I knew where he was living, so I sent someone to find him. But my effort did not bear fruit, and before we
could meet I had to leave the city.  
Then the North Korean army entered Pyongyang and the purges began. On December 4, 1950, we fled
south, pushing Pak Jeong-hwa with his broken leg on a bicycle. We left Pyongyang with the sound of
North Korean army gunfire within earshot. The army occupied the state roads, so refugees traveled south
using narrow paths, going over mountains and through fields toward the 38th parallel. As we traveled, the
North Korean army was only ten kilometers behind us. Pak Jeong-hwa said, "In this situation, all three of
us will die. Therefore, leave me here." He thought he would be a burden on the way and contemplated
suicide, but I realized this and scolded him. Then he calmed down and agreed to stay with us all the way
to South Korea.  
To go to Yongmae Island, I had to carry him across a mud flat on my back. If the tide had come in, we
might have drowned. I can never forget that difficult, muddy stretch of our journey. (549-209,
2006/12/26)

3. The South Korean guards were on the south side of the 38th parallel, and the North Korean army was
on the north side. Since the guards were protecting the border, all roads to the south were blocked. The
38th parallel was heavily guarded, and no civilians were allowed to cross. Therefore, we had to take a
boat at Cheongdan. I sensed ahead of the others that something unusual was taking place at the 38th
parallel. The South Korean guards were stationed on the road at the border crossing, so the guards would
be able to mobilize quickly if there was any disturbance at the 38th parallel. I had sensed the day before
that the South Korean guards were going to mobilize, so we left the border area right away. We walked
toward the dock but there was no ferry, so we had to go to Yongmae Island.  
It was six kilometers from the dock to Yongmae Island across a tidal flat. The challenge was to make it in
two hours during low tide. We had to rush to get across before the tide came in, or it would have been a
disaster. I can never forget those six kilometers, running through the mud while carrying Pak Jeong-hwa
and with Kim Won-pil at my side. We ran with all our strength, trusting in heaven. By the time we got to
the other side, we were covered in mud from head to toe. We barely got across before the tide came in.
(603-115, 2008/11/18)

4. When I headed toward South Korea, I foresaw that shortly North Korea would close the border.
Therefore, I was very concerned about how to cross the 38th parallel. If those who fled with me had not
listened to me at that time, we would not have made it across. The situation was very dangerous. The
South Korean guards were pulling back from the 38th parallel, and we had to move quickly, so I pushed
my companions to hurry without rest. To get on a boat heading south we went to Yongmae Island. But
since all the South Korean guards were retreating from the border and commandeering any boat they
could find, civilians were not allowed to board boats. There was no boat we could get on, so we had to
come back to the mainland and continue on foot to look for a way to cross the 38th parallel. (158-056,
1967/02/14)  

5. When we were close to the Imjin River, I felt intuitively that we had to reach the riverbank before
nightfall. In that situation, I needed to take emergency measures. I raised my spiritual antenna to the
highest level. This was not something I normally did.  
That night, as usual, other refugees sought a place of rest in a town. Yet, sensing that danger was
approaching, we continued on our way even past midnight. At around 1:00 a.m. we arrived at a house
near the river. The house was empty. The owners of the house had left for the South, so we entered. We
continued on and arrived at the riverbank before dawn, but the waters of the Imjin were not yet frozen. I
was worried and thought, "The water must freeze before daybreak. What if it doesn't?" Thank God, the
river froze and we could cross over very early that morning.  
We thought we were the first ones to arrive in the South, but there were many others who had arrived
before us. As the United Nations troops retreated, they blocked the road behind us. Those who came after
us had to return northward. If we had hesitated for even one minute, what would have happened? One
minute can mean life or death. This kind of incident can happen often in our lives, especially when we are
following heavens way. Heavens way is that serious. (057-273, 1972/06/04)

6. After leaving Hungnam Prison, I lived as a wanderer without anything to my name. For two months,
traveling from Pyongyang to South Korea, I begged for food. Sometimes I was indescribably hungry.
However, I could never pray to God asking, "Dear God, there is nothing to eat today. Please give me
something." Rather I consoled God. Sometimes I felt, "Tomorrow, surely, on the road a good-hearted
woman will give me something."  
The next day, a woman in white clothes was waiting on the road and gave me something to eat, saying, "I
had a dream last night, and in it I was told to prepare some food for you. That is why I am waiting for
you. Please enjoy this food." This kind of thing happened quite often. I have had such experiences;
nobody can deny this.  
When the time comes, I want to repay the people and communities that helped me. God and I have the
same heart. No one on earth could know the tears I shed together with God as we embraced each other.
No one can ever measure my profound feelings toward God. All the cells in my body feel pain, just
thinking about those times. (035-190, 1970/10/13)

#### Promise made at the 38th parallel
As he crossed the 38th parallel, True Father offered in prayer a tearful, solemn vow, "I will rally
the free world with these two hands, overcome the Communist Party, and liberate North Korea.
Ultimately I will unite North Korea and South Korea, whatever the cost." He never forgot his
prayer and the vow he made on that day. True Father fought throughout his life to achieve it.  
On December 21, 1950, True Father crossed the Imjin River and began the 80-kilometer walk to
Seoul. On the way, he passed Munsan Station, just south of the demilitarized zone. He crossed the
Han River 24 days after leaving Pyongyang, on December 27, and reached Heukseok-dong in
Seoul, where he had lived during his school days.

7. I can never forget my prayer when I crossed the 38th parallel. "Father! I am going to the South. I came
to the North, but I was not able to fulfill the Will as I originally hoped. I could not avoid imprisonment,
and the most painful thing about that was the feeling of defeat when I could not accomplish the goal. Now
I am being chased to the South with other refugees. I know that even in the South I will receive
persecution. No matter what, I will keep going on this path, even if my way is blocked for ten years or 20
years. I know that one day I will have to return to the North. If I cannot return there in person, I will have
my descendants go there, and if they cannot go I will have my disciples go there."  
This was the resolution I made as I crossed the 38th parallel. Ever since then I have been fighting. With
that determination, I consider ten years as if it were one day. Having made this pledge before God, I look
upon the path differently from how you do. (064-251, 1972/11/12)

8. No one can fathom what I pledged in my heart as I was crossing the 38th parallel. Nor can anyone
fathom the content of the prayers I offered for the future of the providence in South Korea while I was
imprisoned almost three years in North Korea's Hungnam Labor Camp. No one can imagine my tearful
prayers on the day I crossed the 38th parallel amid those sorrowful circumstances.  
I can never forget my prayer for my mother and father, who raised me with their utmost love and care,
and whom I had to leave behind in my hometown. I prayed, "Please do not die. I regret that I had to be
unfilial to you, but wait until I return." I also made a pledge while I was being tortured by the
communists, "I will see the day with my own eyes that I bring your people to submit to God and praise
His holy name. You will testify about Him with your own mouths. I will usher in that day before I die."
You cannot fathom these resolutions of mine. They are lodged deep in my heart. (051-260, 1971/11/28)

9. When I journeyed from the North to the South, I felt as if I were all alone. It seems like only a few days
ago. Many nightmarish things happened during this period. I was only 31 years old and still a young man
when I left Hungnam Prison in North Korea. When I left I was determined to make a new start. I had
faced many hardships in North Korea, but I forgot all the difficulties I had been through. I used my
experiences as motivation for my new start, not letting their memory hinder my way. I felt responsible to
fulfill the way of God's Will by whatever path would be required of me.  
As a young man in my thirties just released from prison, I had the strong determination to make a new
start. It took me almost two months to travel from North Korea to Busan. My journey took me across the
38th parallel and through the city of Gyeongju. Busan was filled with countless refugees, and there was
nowhere to stay. I had no choice but to build a small hut on a hillside for my dwelling. (100-168,
1978/10/14)



Section 3. Wolli Wonbon

God's authorization

```
On May 11, 1951, True Father began writing Wolli Wonbon, Original Text of the Divine
Principle. He completed it on May 10 of the following year. He wrote so fast that the disciple who
was living with him was constantly sharpening pencils in order to keep pace with him. While
writing the first manuscript of the Principle, he tearfully sang hymns and prayed. Sometimes he
climbed to a small outcrop on the mountain behind his cardboard hut to sing and meditate. Then
he returned and devoted all of his heart and soul to his writing.
```
```
The manuscript of Wolli Wonbon consists of five volumes. Each volume was drilled with four
holes and tied. The entire manuscript has more than 690 pages. The text is written with a pencil
```

```
from left to right in cursive script, in both Korean and Chinese characters. The revision work was
done using pens with black, blue and brown ink. Red-colored pencils were used to lightly
underline texts. Interestingly, in ten pages in the middle (pages 291 to 300), the text is written in
blue ink.
```
```
Wolli Wonbon has great significance in that it was written in True Fathers own handwriting. It is
the earliest manuscript of the Divine Principle in existence. In the early days of the church some
of his disciples transcribed Wolli Wonbon and shared their copies with others, passing them
around.
```
1. When I teach about the Principle, I do not refer only to the Bible. Much of its content is not directly
from the Bible. I received most of it directly from God. Jesus did not personally write the Bible; the New
Testament was compiled by his apostles.

The truth must be kept as the truth. Your own theological view or theory must not be added. Did God
authorize you to do so? I am asking you: Are you approved to add your own theory to the truth? I never
presented anything that was not approved by God. I first lived it, and then I presented it to the world.
There is no question about it. That is why it will not perish. (346-055, 2001/06/21)

2. When I was living in Beomil-dong, Busan, I did not even have decent clothes to wear. I had bushy hair
and lived with a young man, Kim Won-pil, in a cave-like shack. When others looked at us, they must
have felt pity for us.

One day, Kim Won-pil said he would work to make money and I said it was okay. At that time, when I
was writing Wolli Wonbon, the first manuscript of the Divine Principle, having even one companion who
followed me, walking the same path, was so precious. You too must experience the taste of such a close
relationship.

Every day when Kim Won-pil set out for work, I accompanied him for at least a kilometer without fail.
Otherwise, I did not feel comfortable. When it was time for him to return home from work, I went out
again to meet and accompany him on the way home. You have no idea how delighted I was to see him
again at the end of each day. When we slept at night we did not have comforters, only one thin blanket to
cover ourselves. That's how we lived back then. (026-070, 1969/10/18)

3. I wrote a book about the Principle, Wolli Wonbon, at Beomil-dong in Busan, overlooking the harbor. I
first noted the main points in outline form, and then started writing. I wrote the ideas in condensed form,
like poetry. Since I just wrote the essential points, people could not easily understand it unless I explained
the main points to them. This is how I wrote the text, which I completed in May 1952.

After Wolli Wonbon came Explanation of the Divine Principle (Wolli Hae-seol) and then Exposition of
the Divine Principle (Wolli Gangnon). (549-211, 2006/12/26)

4. I did not discover the Principle only from reading the Bible. I thought, "If Genesis is the chapter on the
Human Fall, the Book of Revelation is the chapter on restoration. Since something went wrong with the
tree of life, it must be restored through the tree of life. If it does not work that way, the Bible is
misleading." Anything that comes from a seed returns to a seed. That is how it ought to happen. In a
similar manner, the sprout from the seed grows upward, and not sideways. It has to be this way.

The Principle that I am teaching you today is in accord with history from the providential viewpoint. It is
based on a deductive method. Without a doubt, God is alive. As long as God exists and leads the
providence for the Will centering on love, the world will have to enter the era of unity based on the
cultural sphere of God's love. From this perspective, I disclosed why God created heaven and earth, how
the creation of heaven and earth was carried out, and why God is love. (195-140, 1989/11/07)

5. God comforts all sorrowful people. He is also the Lord who reigns over life, death, misfortune and
blessing. That is why human beings want to rely on Him in any situation, especially when in difficult
times. So when you have a heart to care about others, God will come even if you tell Him not to. It is
because in such a place you form a base upon which He can relate to you as His counterpart. That is why
whenever you are doing something good, God will come to you even if you ask Him not to. Wherever
there is goodness, God is present.

For this reason, in Wolli Wonbon, the meaning of "object partner" and "the value of the object partner"
are presented as entirely new concepts. Once you give and receive, you come to have a reciprocal
relationship. The more you give and receive with your counterpart, the better the relationship you will
cultivate. Hence, you will eventually become an object partner with him or her. For this reason, if your
activity centers on God, goodness or truth, it will surely last. (060-163, 1972/08/17)

6. Whenever you carry the Divine Principle book around with you, you must treat it with great reverence.


Imagine if you had the only existing copy. Think about how serious I was to take care of Wolli Wonbon
when I was writing the first manuscript. What would have happened if that manuscript had been lost, or I
had died? I am telling you that such seriousness can determine the life or death of the world.

Have you ever considered that whether your tribe, your nation, the world and even heaven and earth will
prosper or perish depends upon this book and your attitude toward it? Have you ever considered that each
individual's eternal life depends upon it? If you have never entertained such thoughts, you should realize
how distant you are from the world of heart, and how long it will take for you to connect with those who
are dwelling in that world. (073-065, 1974/07/29)

7. Centered on the Principle, and with the Principle, I have come this far. I laid its foundation with
considerable hardships. I invested my blood, sweat and tears while I was writing the Divine Principle
book. Please understand that my bloody tears are embedded in each and every one of its pages, and that
those tears are crying out to you.

I invested my life and sacrificed my youth for the Principle. That is why I am saying that my blood and
tears are pleading to you from its very pages. You must never go against the Principle. Do not ever think
the Principle I am teaching you is of no value. Even God solemnly bows down and honors it. Such is the
value of the Principle. (199-056, 1990/02/15)

The essence of truth

```
True Father emphasized that when he was writing Wolli Wonbon, Original Text of the Divine
Principle, he had little choice but to write in a condensed style rather than with extended
descriptions and explanations, because he was presenting the essence of the truth. This text has a
historic quality, enabling it to touch one's original heart and bring it to explode with the power of
love.
```
```
Eu Hyo-won, the first president of the Unification Church, had thoroughly explored the scriptures
of various religions. However, he confessed that when he first read Wolli Wonbon, he became so
deeply immersed in the amazing world of its truth, weeping so profusely, that it took him days to
transcribe just one page.
```
8. When I wrote Wolli Wonbon, I wrote it in a condensed form. The content of even one page requires
dozens of pages of explanation. An ordinary person is simply not able to understand it deeply, even after
reading and reflecting on it. One day I asked Eu Hyo-won, who had studied medicine, to explain the
Principle, but he said he could not do so. So I explained just one page to him. Then, on the spot, he bowed
down to me and said, "I am sorry. I did not realize that the Principle contained such a profound meaning. I
could never have figured that out on my own." (415-182, 2003/08/14)
9. After coming down from Hungnam to Busan, I started writing Wolli Wonbon on May 11, 1951. I
wrote it in a compact style. No one could understand it well, no matter how much they tried. So I
explained it to Eu Hyo-won, and then his mind opened up. From then on he shed tears on reading each
page of the manuscript, so much so that it became a "manuscript of tears." He would say, "How on earth
could there be such unbelievable contents! With this understanding, the fundamental teachings of
Christianity and communism will be completely overshadowed." (485-269, 2005/01/31)
10. After President Eu Hyo-won read Wolli Wonbon, he pledged in writing that he would be forever
grateful to God even if his body should become a sacrificial offering in front of heaven. At the time I met
Eu Hyo-won, I was walking a solitary path. His coming was truly the work of God. At that time my heart
was absolutely serious about the Principle. Since I was so serious, God worked to bring him to me. God
did this entirely for me. This is how I have been able to come this far. (045-139, 1971/06/24)
11. I guided and taught Eu Hyo-won in such a way that he was able to systematize the entire contents of
the book into the form of Exposition of the Divine Principle.

When I wrote Wolli Wonbon, I sometimes made drastic jumps in logic and wrote the content in a
condensed form. Eu Hyo-won was given a copy of the manuscript before he joined the church. As he read
it, he cried and cried. I believe that he is the first person in our church's history who was so moved after
reading the Principle that he immediately wanted to become my disciple. This happened when he read
Wolli Wonbon, which was even before he ever met me in person.

He wrote a letter to me with the vow, "Based on the words I read in Wolli Wonbon, I will become your
disciple and serve you for eternity." Moved by his letter, I traveled from Seoul to Yeongdo Church in
Busan and held a 21-day workshop, in which he participated. I was told before the workshop that he was
anxious, wondering what it would be like to meet me in person for the first time. But when we met, he
openly shared with me all of his past life, which was filled with many serious stories, some of which I
still cannot forget even to this day.


During the workshop in Yeongdo all the participants had spiritual experiences. So, after the workshop
they felt so transformed that when they returned to the reality of their everyday lives, they marveled, "I
just experienced a completely different world, which I never imagined could exist!" (292-318,
1998/04/27)

Section 4. Pioneer Outreach

Pioneering in Busan

```
After arriving in Busan in January 1951, True Father moved around for half a year, living here
and there as a refugee. In August he built a mud-walled hut with his own hands in Beomnaetgol,
moved into it, and prepared to receive new members. He climbed the mountain every day and
prayed tearfully, with a yearning surpassing even that of God who has continually worked to
restore His lost children. As a result, members came to him in small groups, responding to
revelations they received from God.
```
```
On May 10, 1952, the day when True Father finished writing Wolli Wonbon, Original Text of the
Divine Principle, Gang Hyeon-sil, a second-year student at Goryo Theological Seminary, joined
him. She was followed by others, including Rev. Lee Yo-han, a young man, already a Christian
pastor, who joined Father on December 1. In this way, heaven sent prepared believers to True
Father. By January 1953, the number of members had increased, but at the same time, opposition
from the families of some members became severe. Consequently, True Father left the mud-
walled hut in Beomnaetgol and moved to Sujeong-dong, later moving three more times.
```
1. I lived in Busan for three years as a refugee during the Korean War. While I was there I could hear the
voices of many people who had promised to meet me, crying out to me. Because I was not able to meet
them, my longing heart for those people was indescribable. It was a good opportunity for God to train me
so that, as His Son on earth, I could experience the longing heart of God for humanity.

I did not shed tears because I missed my parents, nor did I stay up all night pining for them. The question
was how I could complete the restoration of Cain and Abel in accordance with the Principle, which was a
stepping-stone for the providence of God to move forward. It was not possible for me to do this with my
own family or relatives. I had to establish a victorious foundation with people who were not my own
blood relations. I established the tribal-level foundation based on making a foundation with people from
other clans. Then I had to advance to the level of the people of Korea. (046-134, 1971/08/13)

2. When I lived in Beomil-dong, Busan, I offered sincere prayer conditions with all my heart, and waited
in yearning for those who should be connected to God. Spiritually I could see them coming, but in reality
they had not yet come. I had no choice but to wait for the right time. When I was living in Beomil-dong,
there were at most three members, including myself. So I communicated spiritually with the ones for
whom I yearned and meanwhile lived with the mountains and valleys as my friends. (018-038,
1967/05/14)
3. When I lived in Beomil-dong, I so much missed being with people that I sometimes talked to myself.
Spiritually I could hear people talking, as if they were behind a thin paper wall. I could hear them, but I
could not see their faces. If only that paper wall were removed, the multitudes could come to me.

I could hear the voices of the people I longed to meet; that is why I missed them so much. From morning
until evening, I longed for people to come. It is a very noble thing to long to see others. Once my heart of
longing to meet people reached a certain degree, they began to come looking for me.

When people are treated with that kind of heart, since they are spiritual beings, even if they want to leave,
it is as if they are glued to the floor and they cannot get up. It is an unusual phenomenon. They become
completely absorbed in what is happening around them.

You must know that there were such spiritual works in the early days of the Unification Church. You too
should have such a longing to meet people. You should not worry about your spouse and children. You
have to yearn to meet people for the sake of the Will. (056-026, 1972/05/10)

4. I am not teaching you thoughtlessly when I say, "With the heart of a parent, shed sweat for earth, tears
for humanity and blood for heaven." This is how I have lived. Try witnessing to people according to this
teaching. Test whether what I say is the truth or a lie. If you do not have members, open the door and long
for them. When you do so, you will hear people coming. Long for people the way I do. Then ways to
reach them will open up. When Gang Hyeon-sil came to Beomnaetgol for the first time, I had the heart of
a parent yearning for my lost children. (160-183, 1969/05/12)
5. When I lived in the mud-walled hut in Beomnaetgol, there was a rumor circulating about me, "Satan's


ringleader lives at the top of Beomil-dong. Christians, do not go there!" Even when we held our own
worship services, everyone in the village church already knew about it and spread rumors, warning people
not to go. But I was never discouraged. When I went to pray on the mountain, I would often catch Satan
spiritually by the collar and fight him. I fought him saying, "You cannot defeat me in this battle. Someday
you will surrender to me." That was how I got started. (153-316, 1964/03/26)

6. When I was in Beomnaetgol in Busan, there was only one other church in Beomil-dong. That church
had heard that we were good people, that we knew the Bible well and that we had attended church in the
past. So they tried to witness to us. I listened to what they had to say. When they spoke, I listened to them
very carefully. They thought that I would surely become a new member of their church and on the first
day they were happy and simply left.

Predictably, the next day they returned. I said, "Let me ask you a question." But they could not answer it.
So I commented, "Would Jesus not know such things? It seems the Bible does not teach you well
enough." I did not speak this way because I thought I was better than them, but because they did not know
the Bible accurately. I told them, "No one can say there is a problem with the Bible itself; the problem is
that you do not know it well. If you do not know the Bible, how are you going to witness?" I continued, "I
do not go to any church. But would you listen to what I know about the Bible?" And I began talking.

At first, I did not say anything that they could not digest. Usually, I would look at the situation and if they
were argumentative people, I would take a totally different approach rather than confront them. After
speaking like this for several hours, they began to listen to what I had to say. (026-071, 1969/10/18)

7. During the days I spent in Busan as a refugee, I built a house in Beomil-dong, and three of us gathered
there to pray and witness. When I spoke to the other two, I imagined that I was not doing so for just those
two people. I thought of us as not just three people, but 30 million people. At the time I was speaking to
only a few people, but I imagined that I was giving a speech to millions of Christians and all of humanity.
I spoke wholeheartedly, shedding sweat, as if the whole town were listening to me. On Sundays, the
neighbors would say, "Ah, that young man is doing it again." Even sitting with them knee to knee and
whispering they would be able to hear me. However, I spoke so loudly that women at the well 150 meters
away could hear me.

One lady who attended the village church happened to hear me when she was passing by. She began
coming to my house every Sunday, where she stood outside and listened to me. She felt uncomfortable
coming into a room filled with young men. Finally, one day she came inside and noticed how pitiful the
room looked. The words I was speaking were big enough to shake up the world, but our reality was
miserable. Nevertheless, I talked about uniting the world and said, "God is our Father and we are God's
sons and daughters. The kingdom of heaven will be realized and hell will be destroyed." (153-315,
1964/03/26)

8. There was a well in Beomil-dong, and people came to draw water from it. When they overheard our
Sunday worship, they were confused, thinking, "There are rumors that the people in that house never fight
with each other, but these days it seems that they are fighting."

On one occasion, a student from a theological seminary came to visit me and said, "In history, people
even greater than you have also dreamed of uniting the world, but they could not accomplish it. How can
you, in this place, think that you will bring unity?" While I was talking with him, I thought about how I
looked and realized that I must surely look pitiful. Who would believe the big things I was speaking about
in a house built so poorly that people could hear water running through its little drain beneath the floor?
My guests ate and dressed better than I did, and had a higher standard of living, so they would not believe
what I taught.

When that seminarian heard what I was saying, my words sparked a hot debate in the area. People who
talked with the seminarian said, "That man up on the hill seems so naive. He does not look like the kind
of person who would say such things, yet his words are incredible. He speaks of turning the whole world
inside out, and heaven and earth upside down." They said, "His place is so shabby and miserable that it is
a place fit only for spirits to live. Yet he speaks of formidable things such as moving the whole world
with one hand, unifying Korea and uniting the world." These were the rumors going around. Even people
in neighboring villages heard about me and said, "At the village well we heard people say that there is a
remarkable person living on the mountain, although he is a young man of few words." As the rumors
spread, more and more people came. (026-072, 1969/10/18)

9. During my time as a refugee, looking out from Beomil-dong I could see the many ships in Busan
Harbor. I thought to myself, "The time will come when I will make a ship of my own and sail into
Busan." Looking at the big ships moving in and out of the harbor, I could not help thinking, "When will
the day come when my beloved sons and daughters can cruise on those big ships and guide the world?
When will their circumstances allow them that freedom and equality?" I thought of God, who has held
this same hope for tens of thousands of years, a hope that will keep growing with each passing day. Now,


amazingly, I stand on the bow of my own boat as it sails toward the ocean. (109-048, 1980/10/26)

10. Busan was a gathering place for refugees. Therefore, it was also the place where the most fervent
Christians could meet each other. Not only that, it brought together people I knew from my school days in
the church in Heukseok-dong, the time of my church in Pyongyang, and the time when I was involved in
a church in Seoul. These were the circumstances under which I began our church.

After I was released from prison in North Korea, I restored four people. These were three women and a
man. The man was in the position of the Archangel. There were three elderly women, Mrs. Ok Sae-hyeon,
Mrs. Ji Seung-do and Mrs. Lee Ki-wan. Lee Ki-wan had been living in Seoul. I brought these four people
together in Busan and made a new start. I found a house in Sujeong-dong and we started a church. (441-
274, 2004/03/06)

Pioneering in Daegu

```
Once new members came flocking in, True Father turned his eyes toward the outside world,
instructing Rev. Lee Yo-han to meet with well-known pastors and spiritual leaders. On July 20,
1953, he gave encouraging words to Gang Hyeon-sil, saying, "Do not forget that the living God
is on our side and cooperating with us." He directed her to take just one change of clothes and go
to Daegu and begin pioneer witnessing there. Daegu would become the first place where the
Principle was taught in public.
```
```
In mid-August, he also sent Rev. Lee Yo-han to Daegu. His plan was for Rev. Lee to build a
church on the foundation laid by Missionary Gang. Our Daegu church took root gradually, and
started holding services that gathered 30 to 40 new members, despite persecution and opposition
from Christian churches.
```
11. During the early days, I led a single church. From that beginning, I gathered a few members and had
them visit spiritually prepared people all over the nation. Among them was Missionary Gang Hyeon-sil,
whom I sent to Daegu. Before she met me, she had been the young lady responsible for the Beomil-dong
Tent Church. Other than that church there were only Buddhist temples in the Beomil-dong valley. She
heard a rumor that an unusual young man was living in a house at the very edge of town, so she came to
witness to me. That is how I met her, and God worked through that. She came looking for me every day.
After some time, she decided to leave her tent church and join the Unification Church.

With that condition, I sent her to Daegu to witness. I sent her to Daegu because that region was like the
Jerusalem of South Korea. I sent her out empty-handed. There was a reason that I sent her out to witness
without even giving her money for a train ticket. It was because in those circumstances the spirit world
was compelled to help her. When she arrived in Daegu, she had no place to go. So the spirit world guided
her to meet someone who was prepared. That is how the Daegu church began. (143-173, 1986/03/18)

12. I told Missionary Gang Hyeon-sil, "Go to Daegu as a pioneer witness!" When she first went out
pioneering, she cried as she witnessed. Then God confided to her, "You have just arrived here, and you
are crying, but I have worked for thousands of years while harboring bitter pain." She had been about to
leave, but after hearing God's voice she decided to stay and endure. When I think about it, God did not
listen to anything she had to say about her situation. He just told her to pioneer and witness to people.
Given those circumstances, when I sent her to a certain place on my behalf, someone was waiting for her
with tickets for her transportation, and further along the way, another person was waiting with a feast.
(348-293, 2001/07/10)
13. When you go witnessing, it will do you no good to just sit down and worry. It is not a mission you can
fulfill with money; you have to make conditions of sincere devotion. On that foundation if you pray
sincerely, God will guide you. Further, if you work hard until your feet get sore and blistered, God can
work through that.

Listen to Gang Hyeon-sil's testimony. She went to Daegu to do pioneer missionary work without knowing
anyone there. Did anyone welcome her? How hard it must have been for her when she was wandering
around on the streets. She was lamenting about her hard luck and praying, "O Lord, where should I go?"
And God said, "Are you complaining after just one day? You are far from reaching the heart of your
Father who has suffered for thousands and thousands of years!" He meant that she had to go through more
hardships. It is not easy to meet God or to find the Will of God. (235-176, 1992/08/29)

14. When I was visiting Daegu, there was one month during which the church had to move 13 times.
Once I came to town, everyone knew who I was. Christians carried my picture, and whenever they saw
me they made a great fuss, saying, "There is that Moon so-and-so." Everywhere I went, the churches were
in an uproar, saying, "Kick out that ringleader of heresy!" The whole city would growl and try to kick me
out. (163-153, 1987/05/01)


Chapter 3. Founding the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity

Section 1. Background

Providential background

```
Upon True Father's return to Seoul on September 17, 1953, he began looking for ways to carry
out his work in that city in earnest. In addition, he visited the churches in Daegu and Busan to
guide and encourage the members working on the front line of those pioneer missions. He offered
many sincere conditions of devotion on behalf of Protestant pastors and government leaders who
had not accepted him. In this way, he established the foundation of faith for a new beginning. He
personally established the standard of Abel's providential mission. On this foundation of vertical
restoration through indemnity, and on the foundations of the three churches, in Seoul, Busan and
Daegu, he sought ways to carry out the horizontal providence of restoration for the foundation of
substance.
```
```
Finally, on May 1, 1954, True Father founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of
World Christianity (HSA-UWC), at a very small house in Bukhak-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul.
That address was later changed to 391-6 Shindang-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul.
```
```
The founding of HSA-UWC signified that, in a providential sense, True Father had established a
church that could represent Judaism and Christianity -- and that he himself could now stand in
the position of Jesus on the foundation of having indemnified what had not been fulfilled through
those two religions. It was because of disbelief and rejection by Christian denominations that
ultimately True Father founded HSA-UWC. He established it on the foundation of having
triumphed in his course of restoration through indemnity in North Korea. In this manner a new
mainstream in God's providence began, with True Father at the center, and changes began to
appear in all areas of society, in the nation and throughout the world.
```
1. Directly after Korea's liberation, I wanted to make a new beginning together with Christianity, but
because of opposition from Christian ministers that phase of the providence was blocked. After that, I was
supposed to work together with the nation of Korea, but that road also was blocked. Just as Israel and
Judaism should have accepted Jesus, similarly Korea and Christianity should have accepted me. They
went in the opposite direction, however. As a result, the churches and the nation deviated from God's
Will.

I had to restore through indemnity the fact that Christianity had become a gentile religion due to Israel's
rejection of Jesus. Just as Christianity had to go through Rome, Satan's realm, in order to develop, I had to
go to North Korea, a communist nation that represented Satan's realm on the world level. From then on, I
had to carry out the work of restoration a second time. I had to pay indemnity on the individual, family
and tribal levels. This is why I have suffered until now. What could have been accomplished in one go
had to be repeated several times. The Unification Church has to represent Judaism. God set up
Christianity to act on behalf of Judaism, but Christianity also was not able to fulfill its responsibility.
Eventually I established the Unification Church to fulfill this responsibility on behalf of Christianity.
(039-137, 1971/01/10)

2. After the establishment of the Republic of Korea, it was not Christianity or other spiritual groups but I
who stood at the center of God's Will. Ever since I began to be persecuted, I stood alone before God. In
the Bible it says your enemies will be members of your own household. Christians were like my family,
but they came to stand in the position of an enemy. As a result, all the foundations prepared by God had
to be discarded. God's Will came to be centered solely on me, and I had to make a new beginning at a
new level from then on. It was a miserable fate for me to bear.

From then on, Christianity drifted further away from God's Will. The democratic world also drifted away
from God's Will and began to go in the wrong direction. I had to go through hardships, and this is why I
spent three years in prison beginning in 1948. After all, North Korea is also part of the land of Korea, so I
had to go there and fight Satan on the front line.

Since South Korea was also on Satan's side, I had to fight in South Korea as well. In both North Korea
and South Korea I could not avoid fighting against Satan's side. My time in North Korea corresponded to
the Old Testament Age and in South Korea to the New Testament Age. This is why I was imprisoned for
three years in North Korea. In December 1950 I left North Korea and laid a foundation in South Korea for
four years before establishing the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity on
May 1, 1954. (087-057, 1976/05/01)

3. Jesus had to endure prison before dying on the cross. This is why the course of restoration must also
begin from prison. Jesus' course should have begun from a glorious position, but his path was completely
reversed and turned into the way of the cross. This is why the history of the Unification Church also had


to begin in prison in order to advance to a new level. When Jesus was in prison, he lost his 12 disciples. I
had the mission to restore this history substantially, to restore the standard of that lost number. Though I
said not a word, God mobilized the spirit world to witness to the other prisoners. Twenty-four prisoners
responded to heaven's call and secretly united with me. This enabled me to make a new start.

When I came out of the prison camp, four people accompanied me. In this way, I made the condition to
establish the four-position foundation according to the Principle of Restoration. It was thanks to God that
this condition could be made. On this foundation, after coming out of Hungnam Prison, I went back to
Pyongyang, regathered the lost members and made a new start. That was the beginning of today's
Unification Church. (071-231, 1974/05/01)

4. The Unification Church has to indemnify the course of restoration that God had led for 6,000 years. We
need to indemnify problems of the individual, family and nation. We have to indemnify everything that
should have been realized by the nation at the time of Jesus. Today, God's providence is advancing, with
Korea at the center. Before the liberation, God prepared and sent many individuals who had the mission
of prophets. Some aspects of the providence were led by women, and others by men. Our nation and
devout people of faith were not aware of it, but in order for God to establish His providence for His Will,
He worked to raise selected individuals, both internally and externally. This is why, after the liberation,
this nation and its people had to make a new beginning based on a new development. The Unification
Church was launched to convey God's Will to them. (016-055, 1965/12/26)
5. North Korea, which is on Satan's side, started the Korean War in 1950 in order to take over South
Korea. As a result of military successes in the heavy air bombardment of Hungnam and General
MacArthur landing his forces at Incheon, I got out of the Hungnam Labor Camp.

Then I trudged to South Korea. At the time, South Korea was in chaos. The foundation I had laid in Seoul
and other places had been entirely destroyed. The South Korean government had been swept away.
People who had money tried to escape, and Christian pastors sent their children abroad. It was a chaotic
time throughout the nation. Under these circumstances, the Unification Church began to lay its
foundation.

As the Unification Church was laying its foundation, Korea settled on a new form of government. This is
the providential viewpoint. The chaos in society was because the providence of heaven was using Satan's
side to create an environment suitable for God's Will. I established HSA-UWC in 1954, and expanded
that new foundation in the midst of a chaotic social environment. The Unification Church developed
while dealing with opposition from the government and from Christianity. (161-073, 1987/01/02)

6. Even though I had a mouth, I did not speak. Although I harbored bitter sorrow over the way the people
of my nation treated me, I endured. It was not because I was spineless. I understood that Jesus had to
endure for 30 years of his life, and God had to go through great pains to find the right time to establish
His foundation. He persevered for 2,0 00 years since Jesus' time to lay a solid base to accomplish His Will.
Therefore, I too endured, saying, "Let the typhoons come; let the snowstorms blow." I knew these harsh
conditions were only temporary and would pass away. It is the same with those in society who boast
about their success; it will pass away.

What was my responsibility? What did I have to do when I found myself in the position of being accused,
chased out and even sent to prison? For the sake of all humanity, to eradicate all the suffering of the
world, I had to be struck. I thought, "In pioneering the path of suffering worldwide, can one avoid
difficulties?" I told myself it was natural to face hardship. It was not because I am a fool that I accepted
these circumstances. The history of the providence of restoration had to unfold this way. For the
providence to advance, there had to be someone like me who was willing to take such a path. This was the
condition on which I established the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity.
(014-309, 1965/01/10)

The Bukhak-dong three-gate house

```
The three-gate house in Bukhak-dong where the sign of the Holy Spirit Association was hung was
a shabby house with eaves so low that people could reach them with their outstretched hands.
This being the case, neighborhood children sometimes took down the sign and used it as a game
board. Sometimes people who opposed us threw it down and broke it, so it was damaged often
and had to be repaired and reattached to the house.
```
```
When you entered the house, you had to pass under three gates with your head bent low. They
opened into a small courtyard of about ten square meters with a well at one corner. Next to the
well was a small platform for clay jars filled with traditional Korean condiments. On the right
side of the house was the master bedroom, about two square meters in area, so small that when
people lay down in it, their feet touched the wall and there was barely room for three. To the left
was a second bedroom, a guest room that was not even three square meters in area. The men
```

```
used the master bedroom, while the women slept in the second bedroom. The rooms had a low
paper ceiling that would bend upward if your head touched it.
```
```
As is apparent from this description, HSA-UWC began in a place that was little more than a
shanty. Although only a small number of people gathered inside, True Father still prayed and
spoke in a roaring voice as if speaking to thousands of people. He spoke so passionately that his
shirt would be drenched in sweat. Sometimes he would speak to just one person, yet afterward he
would weep for more than an hour and offer a heartfelt prayer. Everyone who came there was
filled with so much divine grace that they all wept their hearts out, and the floor would be soaked
with their tears.
```
7. The name I created for the Unification Church was "Holy (Divine) Spirit Association for the
Unification of World Christianity." It was hard enough to bring unity within Christianity on earth, yet I
was striving to bring unity in the spirit world as well. Back then I did not have any money. So I rented
this place where the rooms were so small that when I lay down my feet would touch the wall. It was from
such a humble place that I started the church. I took the position of a servant, doing everything for the
people who came. In this way I advanced from the position of a servant to that of an adopted son. This
was the path of my liberation. (093-057, 1977/05/01)
8. The first house where we displayed the Unification Church sign was a small shanty. The entrance had
three gates. People who were tall and wide like me had to enter sideways, with our heads down. It was
there that we mounted the sign, "Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity." It is
an enormous task to unite Christianity on earth, and yet this was an association that aspired to unite
Christianity not only throughout the physical world but in the spiritual world too. Isn't this a formidable
vision? We had placed the sign under the eaves, at one end of the house. Yet despite the grand name on
the sign, when you looked at the house, you would see nothing but a shanty. (200-081, 1990/02/24)
9. We put up the first sign of the Unification Church at the Bukhak-dong house in Seoul. That house was
probably the smallest house in Seoul. When I lay down sideways, my feet touched the wall. Only when I
lay down lengthwise would my feet not touch the wall. One room was like that, and a second room was
about the same. This house was known for its three-gate entrance, and so it was called "three-gate house."
Those gates were tiny, so we had to lower our heads in order to enter. The sign was hung up under the
eaves, which were so low that even children could reach up and touch it. Our sign was not hung on a great
big house but on the smallest house in the city. Who would be interested in us? People even pitied the
sign because it was so mistreated. The neighborhood children often took it down and played with it, and it
was often damaged. Once a person who opposed us came and said, "You want to unite Christianity?
That's heresy!" Then he smashed the sign with a rock, breaking it into pieces. I could not throw away this
historic sign, so I put the two pieces back together with metal braces and hung it up again. (200-162,
1990/02/25)
10. Whether I lived under the eaves of some house or in a shanty, my thought was, "I have to attend God
here and offer greater devotion." My belief was, "According to the Principle of Restoration, the leader
who can offer sincere devotion for the world should be able to do it even in the tiniest house." This was
my way of thinking. Then I would say, "Now that I have offered sincere devotion in this tiny house, I
should be able to offer it in a bigger house befitting a world leader."

The Unification Church began in this place. The Unification Church has grown to this size starting from
this tiny Bukhak-dong house with its three gates. This is the main philosophy of the Unification Church.
Although there have been many rumors about us, so much so that all the world has heard about us, no has
one criticized the Unification Church for its small size. What was most important was what we did in that
place. (062-241, 1972/09/25)

The mission of HSA-UWC

```
The founding of the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC)
is significant in that it was to fulfill the mission that was to have been carried out by Christianity.
Of course, HSA-UWC is the parent religion that needs to ultimately take charge of God's
providence of restoration. This is why the name includes the words "World Christianity."
"Unification" signifies uniting not only Christianity but also other religions and even all
humankind. The words "Holy (Divine) Spirit" incorporate the goal of establishing a foundation
for the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven, through the harmony of the spiritual world
and the physical world based on God's truth. The word "Association" refers to an organization
that realizes the originally intended, ideal world by perfecting the united realm of the spiritual
world and the physical world.
```
11. Why did we take the name, Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity?
Because we had Christianity in our name, we were persecuted. But without it, we would have had to give
up the Old Testament Age and the New Testament Age. Without the Old Testament Age, the New


Testament Age could not have come.

Since the Old Testament Age went wrong, the New Testament Age was needed. Without the New
Testament Age, the Completed Testament Age could not have emerged. The New Testament Age came
on the foundation of the Old Testament Age, and the Completed Testament Age came on the foundation
of the New Testament Age, so the Unification Church has to be connected to Christianity. Christianity is
the extension of Judaism. If I threw that away, I would have no ground to stand on. The national level that
Satan rules is the completion level of the growth stage, and until I can go over that stage and gain an
independent foundation, I have to stand on Christianity, the Old Testament Age and the New Testament
Age. (284-189, 1997/04/17)

12. I gave such a grand title to our church: the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World
Christianity. Is such unification even possible? Yes, it will be realized without a doubt. Christianity alone
has over 4 00 denominations that have been fighting each other. But I do not think the unification of
Christianity will be that difficult. I believe that if we are a religious group that follows the principle of
living for the sake of others, and all other religious groups make an effort to do the same, we will all
become one without fail.

Even if religious leaders call this heresy, if we can demonstrate greater love than they do, I believe we can
embrace even them. This is because God, the subject partner, is such a being. When we establish a
relationship with God, I believe we are bound to come into unity by the power of God. This is logical. It
is not so difficult to achieve oneness. The Unification Church was founded on this principle. (072-022,
1974/05/07)

13. When we say "Unification," tong-il, the character tong does not mean "to be guided" but "to lead."
You have to lead. When you want to lead someone, you must have qualities with which you can lead. As
the subject partner, you need those qualities so that you can take responsibility to protect and raise people.
Therefore, the Unification Church has to take responsibility for heaven and earth. The scope of what the
Unification Church is trying to do is different from that of other groups.

You then have to protect this world that is being attacked by the realm of evil. You have to protect it by
creating an environment in which there is only goodness. You must not only deter the evil things but also
develop the good.

The Unification Church is to lead the world and make it one. I am not saying that we should unite the
world centering on the Unification Church. We have to unite the world centering on God, the Creator of
the universe, the subject partner and root of all. (209-121, 1990/11/28)

14. Unification is simple. The word "unity" is the best gospel. If you want to stand with confidence in
front of your father and mother, you have to stand in the place where your mind and body are united.
When you look at yourself, if your behavior is aligned with your conscience, or if you are aligned with
the standard of the moral teachings you learned in school, you can stand tall. If your mind and body are
united, you can uphold your dignity. This is why filial children can stand confidently before their parents
-- in their thoughts, emotions and behavior in daily life. It is upon this foundation of dignity that parents
find the will to live and establish the dignity of their family.

This is the principle of heaven and earth. This is why the term "unification" is great. After searching
through all of heaven and earth, I found that the only appropriate word for the name of our church was
"Unification," and this is why I chose this word for our name. (233-030, 1992/07/20)

15. The religion of the son, representing the desire of all religions throughout the Old Testament Age and
New Testament Age is connected with the religion of the servant and the religion of the adopted son. At
the same time, the religion of the son has to reach the realm of the religion of the parents and form one
system that can be recognized officially by God and the spirit world. When that happens, the unification
of worldwide Christianity will be accomplished automatically.

Based on this, I put up the HSA-UWC sign. I am saying that it is the association by which the Divine
Spirit can unite Christianity. Some may think that it is simply an association of Unification Church
members, but in fact it is an association led by the Divine Spirit of God to unite Christianity.

Since we include the word "spirit" in the name of our church, because people in the world do not fully
understand the meaning of the Divine Spirit of God that we are centered on, they say we are connected to
spirits or ghosts. This is why we Unification Church members are called "michin" (crazy) people.
However, this word used as a verb, michida, means "to reach." We are michin people because we are
reaching the goal. Ours is the religion that is striving to fulfill the goal of the Old and New Testaments,
which is the Will that all the spirits in the spirit world want us to fulfill centering on God's love. This is
why in the Unification Church the work of God's Divine Spirit continues. (113-098, 1981/05/01)


16. The Unification Church needs God's help. Of course, it receives support from good spirits such as our
good ancestors, but I am saying we should also receive the spiritual support of the founders of the world's
religions. We need to expand our scope. We cannot expect cooperation only from the Christian spirit
world. The Christian spirit world is only concerned with the Christian world; this is why it is not enough.
If we are to unite the entire world, we cannot do so only with the support of the Christian spirits centered
on Jesus. We have to receive the spiritual support of all religions. We should receive help from our good
ancestors, from the loyal patriots and virtuous women of Korea, and further, we should have the
cooperation of the founders and saints of the world's religions. (084-067, 1976/02/22)
17. What is the ultimate goal of God, who has been leading human history for 6,000 years since the Fall?
It is to find His sons and daughters, loyal subjects and virtuous women, upon whom He can bestow the
marriage Blessing before all of heaven and earth. This is God's work, and it will be done with one place
on earth as the central point. In this place, words conveyed with heart on behalf of God will move the
spirit world. If these words can reach the hearts of people who are true to their conscience, their hearts
will be greatly moved. When these activities become widespread on earth, Satan's world will collapse.

We who are striving to achieve this goal are raising the torch in front of the world and all of heaven and
earth. Because during this era we shoulder this tremendous name, the Holy Spirit Association for the
Unification of World Christianity, we must not allow ourselves to collapse. We must penetrate God's
heart. This is the source of the message by which we can reach every level, from the individual and
family to the society, nation, world and cosmos. If we cannot do this, we had better take down the sign. I,
whom you have been following thus far, am focused on making this breakthrough. This has been my
lifelong goal. (009-115, 1960/04/24)

18. The fact that we established ourselves as the Unification Church was a risky venture. Our name,
which includes the word "unification," describes our purpose to unite all religions. What a vast and
incredible ambition! When we look at the 2,000-year history of Christianity, numerous theologians came
and went, and numerous denominations were created, presented new doctrines and set up their own
traditions. Those theologians who started new denominations criticized the older doctrines as mistaken
and rejected them. In this way the Protestant cultural sphere was formed. Eventually Protestantism
established a worldwide foundation, yet at the same time it divided into numerous denominations.
Therefore, Christianity itself is not united. It will not be easy to unite Christianity alone, but we claim that
we will unite not only Christianity but all religions, and even the physical world and the spiritual world.
(202-008, 1990/05/01)
19. To transform the world of Satan's sovereignty back to the world of God's sovereignty, you must
follow God's Word absolutely and unite with Him to defeat the world of Satan's evil. If you do not win
this fight, then the Lord at his Second Advent will have to find others and re-engage in this struggle. You
have to raise a worldwide movement in which you volunteer to take up this laborious path in order not to
leave the Returning Lord in such a difficult and lonely position. Unless you do this, there will be no way
forward for Christianity.

Then what should the Unification Church do? We must become a group that absolutely believes in God's
Word. No matter how much persecution we face from Satan's world, we must unite with God. The
mission of the Unification Church is to grow into a movement that can, with God's love, liberate the
world from Satan. We need to establish the worldwide foundation for a new Christianity that transcends
national boundaries. What I am saying is that we need to establish a foundation for the Returning Lord to
carry out new works worldwide, realizing the sovereignty that the people of Israel could not accomplish
on earth. (053-046, 1972/02/06)

20. What kind of truth is religion meant to express? We do not need truth that simply presents doctrines.
It has to be a truth with which your body, mind and heart can all agree, saying, "That's it!" We need such
principles and teachings. If you hear something about them and then encounter them, your heart will be
drawn to them. If you hear teachings that attract you, that make you feel as if you are transcending time
and space, then you had better pack up your bags and follow those teachings. You will not perish. You
will be remembered in history.

If you want to become such a person, you cannot do it with your old self. Please take off your old,
defective mask and throw it away. If you are a religious person, please take off your religious mask. If
you are a conscientious person, please take off that mask. Please take down your religions sign. Right
now you are all part of the Unification Church, but I long for the day when I can take down the
Unification Church sign. I had to put up the Unification Church sign only because of the prevailing
circumstances, because there was an opponent to struggle against.

We have to take down that sign someday. What kind of sign do we need in the world of mind and heart?
Even without a sign, you will already know yourself. Even without making intentional effort, you will
naturally know and do what is right. This is the primary standard through which you will be able to
resolve anything. (007-253, 1959/09/20)


21. My purpose for founding the Unification Church was not only to benefit our church. On this
anniversary of the founding of the church, we have to broaden our scope. We need to make this day the
day for guiding our nation to God's Will, and we need to make this day the day we guide the entire world
to build the kingdom of heaven on earth that God hopes to see. It is to fulfill this mission that the
Unification Church was founded.

The Unification Church is different from all other churches that have appeared in history. Representing
the entire providence, it has to indemnify everything and settle all accounts. At the same time, the
Unification Church carries the overall responsibility to leave behind a victorious foundation with which
God can be happy and that gives Him hope for the future.

Therefore, the Unification Church was not founded merely to build a denomination. It was founded to
take on the whole providence and to build the one foundation that is centered on the Will. Based on the
founding of this church, individuals are to stand anew before God. These individuals must solidify a
philosophy of life and establish a tradition for new families, new tribes, new peoples, new nations and the
new world that will continue on into the future. (043-232, 1971/05/01)

The mission of church members

```
HSA-UWC aims to build a community of family members centered on true love. The term shikku,
meaning "family member," refers to the members of a church family who eat together at the same
table. Family members have the mission to realize the kingdom of heaven on earth, centering on
God's love and the ideal of creation. They also have the responsibility to dissolve the bitter
sorrow of Jesus, who was unable to love his parents, relatives, the synagogues, the people of
Israel, the nation of Israel and the world. This is why members of the Unificationist family are
devoting all of their energy to realizing one world under God, as members of one great family
transcending all barriers of ideology, religion, race and nationality.
```
22. Jesus and the people of Israel in his day were chosen to represent the 4,000-year history of God's
providence. Likewise, you, the saints on earth who are chosen today, represent the entire world and its
6,000-year history, transcending peoples and nations. If you do that, then God's judgment as foretold in
the Bible will be removed from the earth.

To achieve this standard, we hung up the Unification Church sign, and we call each other "family
members." We are a family. We are brothers and sisters, although not blood-related, and we are one tribe.
We are one brotherhood and one tribe, and we are building the Israel that will take responsibility to
establish the Parent-child relationship with God. To do this, we must experience Jesus' bitter sorrow, take
the path of pioneers, go through the course of fighting against Satan, and fulfill God's Will. (002-221,
1957/05/26)

23. When we established the Unification Church, it was as if we were finding and reestablishing Judaism
as God intended it to be. To build up the Unification tribe is as if we are recovering the lost tribes of Israel
and recovering the brothers from whom those tribes stemmed. In this sense, all Unification Church
members need to become brothers and sisters. It is only by making that connection of brotherhood that we
can form a tribe. Unless we connect as brothers and sisters, we cannot build a church, nor can we form a
people or a nation.

Therefore, the Unification Church has the mission to connect all people centering on this relationship of
brothers and sisters. This is the meaning of the term "family member." Because we are family members,
we call each other brothers and sisters. The term "family member" is foundational to building the
kingdom of heaven. This is why in the Unification Church we use this term. This is also the reason
Unification Church members should love one another. (037-171, 1970/12/25)

24. Today, in the Unification Church we call ourselves a family. However, you also use the term "family"
when referring to your family by blood. Then on what basis do we in the Unification Church call
ourselves a family? We call one another family based on God's love for us. We do so because God desires
to have that precious, loving relationship with all of humankind and for each one of us. And we do so
because we are striving to fulfill the ideal of creation that God originally intended to realize. All people in
history have wanted to have the kind of connection to one another that we have. These are the kinds of
relationships implied in the word "family."

We are here in this movement having this central relationship with one another. Therefore, if we are close
to someone, we should love that person with a love surpassing that of anyone in the world. And if we are
loving someone who is distant from us, we should love that person with a higher love than others do in
the world. (025-285, 1969/10/05)

25. While you are sleeping, some of your brothers and sisters are following the Will, staying up late at


night and shedding tears. While you have a full stomach, some of your fellow family members are going
hungry. Therefore, even when you are eating or sleeping, you need to have a tearful heart, help them
through spiritual power, pray for them and make an altar for them. You should always keep the altar clean
and pray to God, telling Him that you are ready to submit yourself as an offering, day or night. Especially
when a brother or sister is going through a difficult course of the cross, you should at least prepare
internally to fight alongside the person. Otherwise, sooner or later you will end up being separated from
those who are fighting on the front line. If that happens, you will fall behind and end up a defeated
soldier. (156-069, 1965/12/07)

Section 2. The Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church

The central base

```
HSA-UWC was founded on May 1, 1954 at a small house in Bukhak-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul.
On January 17, 1955, the church moved to 241-44, Heungin-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, and on
April 27, to a two-story building with a garden at 37, Jangchung-dong 1-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul. On
October 7, 1955, right after True Father was released from Seodaemun Prison, it moved yet
again, this time to 71-3, Cheongpa-dong 1-ga, Yongsan-gu, Seoul. This is the address that the
church used on May 31, 1963, when it registered with the government as Civil Society
Organization No. 261. It is where True Father offered countless prayers while shedding tears and
where he made many conditions of devotion for the advancement of the providence. It is where he
educated members day and night and where he prepared to expand the providence to the
worldwide level.
```
1. When we think about all the people in today's world who died for God, just as Elijah said, all I can say
is, "Lord, I alone am left." It is with that heart that I am leading the providence in these miserable
circumstances at the shabby Unification Church building whose address is 71-3, 1-ga, Cheongpa-dong,
Seoul. This is the place under the sun where I am expanding the base for the salvation of the fallen world.
How sad God must feel as he looks down at this place, where a small band of followers and I are striving
to dissolve the 6,0 00 years of His bitter sorrow. When I think of this, tears well up in my eyes.

Tears flow down my face when I think of God's situation, so sad and painful. But the question is how
much you have experienced that heart. In the Unification Church, do you relate to God with such a heart?
You have not been thinking this way. (027-075, 1969/11/23)

2. The relationships we have brought for humankind are three-dimensional. They are not based on any
philosophy or ideology that ever existed before. They are relationships originating in God's heart and His
ideal of creation, and from the standard of original nature and character. These relationships are the
essence of all relationships. Therefore, you must guard their absoluteness.

These relationships have emerged here at Cheongpa-dong. The meaning of Cheongpa-dong is "green
hills," and green hills symbolize the ideal. At Cheongpa-dong, people live singing and aspiring for the
ideal world of peace and freedom, where people sing with hope that is fresh and green. Hence, our
Headquarters Church in Cheongpa-dong is the base where we begin the four-position foundation on the
horizontal plane. (049-206, 1971/10/10)

3. Cheongpa-dong Church was built on the site where a Buddhist temple stood long ago. During the
Japanese occupation, Japanese families lived there. This is such a historic building. After I was released
from Seodaemun Prison in 1955, I had nowhere to go, and I did what I had to do to purchase this
property.

At first the condition of the house was so terrible that it was like a den of ghosts. Even the poles
supporting the ceiling were tarnished black, and we had to wash them with harsh soda to get them clean.

So many past relationships were intertwined within the structure. So after I bought this house, I resolved,
"While I am living here, I will ease the pain in all those spirits' bitter, vengeful hearts that have
accumulated over a long history. I will make those who whipped others kneel down, and expel those who
kicked out the innocent people living there." Even now, I have not forgotten my resolution. Even if
everyone leaves me and I am all alone, I will not forget. I will always keep the spirit to subjugate the
entire fallen world. (051-227, 1971/11/28)

4. We must plant God's flag to save Korea. We gathered here to praise His victory in all the places where
that flag is raised high. From the outside, this building may seem like nothing, but even though I live in
this small and humble house, I have a dream of someday leading the whole world.

Some people ask me why Cheongpa-dong Church Headquarters is so shabby, even as the Unification
Church makes such a sensation worldwide. Indeed it looks shabby, even to me. Its roof was messy with
broken tiles and in need of repair, but I leave it as it is without fixing it. It is not because I do not have the


money, but I would rather save that money and spend it for the salvation of the Korean people.

When my efforts grow from today's fledgling efforts to reach public awareness, the people of Korea will
understand what the Unification Church has done for them. When the people come to know our history,
how we have fought for this nation on their behalf, they will weep in deep repentance. We sincerely hope
to see that day, and we are ever marching forward to welcome it. The problem is not whether the house in
which I live needs many repairs. I cannot make my residence comfortable as long as this nation and its
people have many wounds that need to be healed. (022-105, 1969/01/26)

5. You need to maintain your dignity as the members of the Headquarters Church. You need to be able to
encourage and raise the spirit of overseas members who yearn to visit the original homeland, who yearn
to meet the people there, who yearn to live there and even stay there forever. If you cannot be God's
representatives, with His heart, and relate to all humanity from that position, you cannot be the people of
the original homeland.

You need to have the heart to welcome overseas family members who come to see the original homeland.
Whether they are here for a day or two, or even a year, you should be able to live with them joyfully, and
so close that your foreheads touch. Because they want to love you, you should be prepared to share all the
joys and pains of life with them. Otherwise, you will certainly hurt the many members who will come
from abroad to visit Korea and who regard it as their original homeland.

Cheongpa-dong Church is not just an ordinary place. Countless members from Unification Churches from
every corner of the world will come to Korea, regarding it as their original homeland. In particular, they
will visit Cheongpa-dong Church and hold it in high esteem. Don't be discouraged because its current
condition is not good. People who come to visit here will not expect to worship at a majestic palace.
Rather, they will come longing to embrace this humble Cheongpa-dong Church. (023-087, 1969/05/11)

A historic holy ground

```
At the original Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church, the first floor was used as a sanctuary or a
main hall, and the second floor housed True Father's bedroom, the church office, a hall for
commemorative ceremonies, a counseling office and employees' lodgings. At the time, so many
members came to the church. Especially on Sunday, the sanctuary was filled to the bursting point.
True Father would pour out his words, full of grace. The atmosphere of the church services was
always filled with divine spirit. When former church president Eu Hyo-won began giving Divine
Principle lectures every day, the members' spirits were lifted even higher. The sanctuary would
be overflowing with members. Behind the scenes, the elderly women members continually prayed
and offered devotions. Miracles occurred one after another. It was like a blast furnace of heart,
where tears, laughter, reports and testimonies, Divine Principle lectures and the singing of holy
songs never ceased.
```
```
It also was the place for historic events, including True Parents' Holy Wedding, the establishment
of the church's four great holy days, the birth of the True Children, the 36 and 72 Couples
Blessing Ceremonies, and many others. When members throughout Korea offered their devotions
with bows and prayers, they faced in the direction of this main church.
```
```
The Cheongpa-dong Church is a holy altar and a historic holy ground. It is stained with the
countless tears True Parents shed. That is why anyone from anywhere in the world who knows
about the providence yearns for this place and finds their way to it sooner or later. For this
reason, True Father said that it should not be remodeled but preserved in its original form. This
is because, no matter how shabby it may be, it is a place of nostalgia, full of historical memories
and stories.
```
6. The main Unification Church is here in Cheongpa-dong, Seoul. Do those who work or live here have
any qualification to do so? Even though I do not say anything, I shed tears dozens of times a day. Those
who live close to me know how I live. Even when I hear one word from a member, I can burst into tears. I
am such a sensitive person.

Even at this moment, I hear family members throughout the nation praying in pain and sorrow. Some are
going hungry; others are suffering from persecution. Still others are in circumstances that allow them no
freedom. You who work or live at Cheongpa-dong need to be the catalysts for conveying my heart to
those family members. Since you work here, whenever it is necessary you must be willing to pay a greater
price. That is why whenever I want to reveal something new, I do not first speak about it at the
Headquarters Church. I share it with the members in the local churches first, and only afterward at the
Headquarters Church. Those who live in the local churches pray more than those at the headquarters. As
people who belong to the Headquarters Church, you should set the highest standard, so that you will not
be ashamed before heaven and earth. (012-327, 1963/08/11)


7. You need to know that there are people who shed tears when they just look at a photo of Cheongpa-
dong Headquarters Church or even when they simply remember it. You have to be able to welcome those
who come here in tears, become their friends, and comfort them from the bottom of your heart. I sincerely
want you to receive many blessings from heaven and become people of whom I can be proud before God.
This is because you live together with me and we have a special bond -- a bond formed from having
shared all kinds of life experiences, both joyful and sorrowful. (012-329, 1963/08/11)
8. I know it is not easy to live with so many people crammed into this small church. We are not the only
ones who are aware of this. God knows it even better than we do. Seeing us like this, people outside our
community may think us foolish, but I do not agree. I have never prayed to God, asking, "Please build me
a church." I even feel honored to be in this situation, with so many people in this small, cramped place.

When there is an event here, everyone pushes and shoves to come inside. When this happens, rather than
feeling miserable, you should have the heart to comfort God's sorrow, praying, "Aren't we fortunate to be
in this situation?" You need to attend events with this kind of heart.

When our church has people with this kind of heart, we will be able to pay the indemnity to restore the
world. These miserable circumstances are a true treasure that we Koreans experience, and they are a
resource we can use for restoration through indemnity. These circumstances are not a condition for
unhappiness. They are rather a condition that bestows upon us the benefit and grace of deeply penetrating
God's inner heart and situation, connecting us to the level of His heart and His desire to build us a better
church. (017-273, 1967/02/15)

9. In the future, people from around the world will come to visit Cheongpa-dong Church. This is not just
an empty dream; they will come. Because I lived here, and because from here I pursued the Will of God,
they will come, crossing national borders to follow the vision I have been teaching.

If I wanted to build a new church building, I could do it even now. But this house was the main church
where many historical events were held. It is the place where heaven and earth wept profusely. It is the
place where many people wept as they experienced God's bitter pain. It is the place where I desperately
appealed to God, even shedding blood. The stains of my tears in this place are connected to unforgettable
memories. It is a sacred altar stained with countless tears of mine and others. It is not the kind of place
you can walk in and out of casually. I have never treated this place in such a casual way. (012-328,
1963/08/11)

10. You should not violate the foundation that I created here with my devotions and prayers. The
Unification Church has been following God's 6,000-year history, always pursuing God's Will. Therefore,
anyone who fails to leave tear-stained footsteps while walking this path cannot become a person of
heaven. That is what I believe.

I would like to ask you: When you kneel down and pray in tears on this wooden floor, do you feel that
this is the ground of hope that Heavenly Father has eagerly awaited for tens of thousands of years? Do
you experience the feeling of your bone marrow melting and feel in your heart that you are connected to
God in flesh and blood? Are you ever overwhelmed by sorrow and grief that begins with tears but that
tears alone cannot end, so much so that you forget about yourself? Also, when you pray in your daily life,
do you ever completely forget about your personal situation?

I have laid my foundation with deep prayer and sincere devotion in the most difficult situations, and you
need to do likewise. If you have not, you will be accused by the level of my devotion. It is the same for
me. God has walked the path of suffering for eons while offering devotion for the Will, and I think that I
shall be judged by the standard of His devotion. To be judged based on His devotion will be a most
fearful judgment. Therefore, in every circumstance of my life I struggle desperately with the question of
how I can offer even an hour of devotion such that Heavenly Father feels compelled to comfort me. (042-
233, 1971/03/14)

11. If visitors complain or make negative remarks about the Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church when
they see it, finding it to have a different standard from what they had expected, the heart of longing they
had for the church will vanish. If someone feels, "This is not what I was hoping to see," and utters such
words about it, then even though that person offered much devotion for the main church in the past, that
offering will have been in vain.

Looking at the shabby Headquarters Church, if that person thinks, "Should this place where I offered
devotions for so long remain the way it is? I will pay any price and make any sacrifice to make this
church better than any other denomination's headquarters church," and if he makes this resolution before
heaven in tears, I believe that he will become my companion in the Will. Because his standard is higher
than anyone else's, God will embrace him in His bosom.

I have heard many times, directly and indirectly, that most of the overseas family members cannot help


but feel this way. If this is what family members overseas feel and think, the Unification Church members
in Korea should not let themselves fall behind them in caring for the Cheongpa-dong Church. (051-217,
1971/11/28)

12. At the Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church, we held True Parents' Holy Wedding Ceremony, an
event unprecedented in history. Here too, we conducted many historic works; God's Day, Parents' Day,
Children's Day and the Day of All Things were inaugurated here. The Holy Wedding took place here in
1960. The 36 Couples and 72 Couples were given the marriage Blessing here as well. This is a historic
place and we must not disgrace it.

If I wanted to build a new church, I could do it right away. I could take down this building and build a
church structure better than any other church in Korea. However, I am not greedy. I do not hope to get
something unless I first offer devotion and my motivation is God-centered. We cannot establish the true
history and tradition simply by using money for a beautiful new building. (051-228, 1971/11/28)

13. The Unification Church that you see in front of you with your own eyes is not everything. More
important is what is behind it. I visited numerous palaces during my tours of dozens of countries.
However, when I visited them I said to myself, "I will save the world starting from my small place." If I
offer more devotion in this small place than in the extravagant buildings of the world and make a spring
of deep devotion and heart there that God will remember, I believe thirsty people will come to my spring.
It does not matter whether the water of life pours out of a rocky cave or from high on a mountain ridge.
Everyone will go to that spot regardless of where it is. If that place yields true spring water, even a city
will be built there. That place can become the original place of God's history and the birthplace of His
culture. (051-229, 1971/11/28)
14. When I see the pillars holding up the ceiling at the Cheongpa-dong Church, I remember the time when
I shed tears holding onto one of them. I can recall our church history and remember vividly the time when
our whole nation was against us.

I know some people who keep their loved one's handkerchief inside their bosom as a treasure among all
treasures and find solace from it throughout their lives. For others, that handkerchief may be something
they can throw away in the washroom, but to the former, it is more precious than their own lives. A
handkerchief does not cost much, but once love is involved with it, it becomes priceless. (083-172,
1976/02/08)

Section 3, Conditions of Devotion and Guidance on Faith

Investment and acts of devotion

```
After he was released from Seodaemun Prison, True Father lived at the original Cheongpa-dong
Headquarters Church. The years that followed, until early 1957, were a period when he made
preparations to advance to a new stage. During this time True Father devoted all his energy to
educating members. He focused on outreach activities, with Eu Hyo-won, the first church
president, giving lectures and teaching the Divine Principle. In addition, True Father often took
members on recreational outings in nature to cultivate their physical discipline and their
relationship to the creation.
```
```
The life of faith of the members was more intense at that time than at any other time in the history
of our church. They attended church services, participated in outreach activities, and studied the
Divine Principle. True Father himself led the church services. Although he wore a humble work
jacket and the church hall was small, it was always filled with members day and night. In the
congregation were many women, many young people, and intellectuals, including university
professors. Everyone participated in outreach activities as volunteers, each with his or her own
method of witnessing.
```
1. During the time of pioneering in 1957, I slept only two hours a day. In those days I would pray together
with the members all night. It was in the midst of a seven-year period during which I prepared and trained
myself so that in the 1960s, when we would move into a new world, I would not be ashamed before
heaven and would be victorious in my 21 -year course. (114-232, 1981/10/20)
2. After I founded the Unification Church, I offered prayers and conditions of devotion every day for
seven years, staying up in my bedroom until 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. My heart was determined, "I will pour out
all my sincerity and devotion. No matter how tired and exhausted I am, I will continue. Even when I am
hungry, I will pour out my whole self. I will not let sleep overcome me. I will continue until I build a
foundation that meets with heaven's official approval."

My devotion with this kind of heart sowed seeds that were connected to God's heart. They will bring forth
growth throughout the world. Even if the members of the Unification Church today cannot inherit those


seeds, some day without fail their fruits will be harvested, if not in Korea then somewhere else in the
world. This is what I think. (082-324, 1976/02/01)

3. In the early days of the Unification Church, I prayed so intensely that my nose bled. I thought, "Even
though I am bleeding like this for the sake of human history, if that blood moves people to feel indebted
to me and so ashamed that they cry bitterly that they cannot repay it, that would be a glorious thing." I
also thought, "It is an honor to be whipped on behalf of the people of the world." This is true.

Who is the patriot among all patriots? If two people suffer a whipping for the sake of the nation, one
receiving 10 lashes and the other 100 lashes, the latter is a greater patriot. A person who receives 1,0 00
lashes is an even greater patriot, and if someone appears who is whipped with 10,0 00 lashes, he will be
greater still; all the nation's fortune will adhere to him. Then, what if another man comes and is whipped
with 100,000 lashes? Even if this person tries not to take it, all the nation's fortune will be given to him.
Don't seek fortune in any other way. This is the way to receive it. (047-334, 1971/08/30)

4. You have to inherit what I prepared when I sacrificed myself in my youth. By so doing, you should
advance to a victorious position where all nations praise you. If you live for the sake of all nations, loving
them, you will surely attain victory. It is my earnest desire for you to advance to a position even higher
and more glorious than mine. But do you want to receive that fortune by just sitting around doing
nothing? It is time for you to stand on the front line.

During the early years of the church, I trained members day and night so that they would not be swept
away into the evil world. For example, one day when we climbed up Mt. Gwanak, it was raining hard.
The path was very slippery, but despite the difficulties we climbed all the way to the top. This is how I
trained the members to fight on the battlefield against the nation and the world, so that they would not
become remnants of a defeated army. I trained them like this despite all the accusations that came against
me. (143-331, 1986/03/21)

5. In 1957 when I was educating the church members in Korea, I used what I call the one-on-one strategy.
It is a strategy that will last until the end. I gave my lecture in front of one person as if I were giving it to
hundreds and thousands of people, thinking that upon that person would depend hundreds and thousands
of people. In order to raise that person as an authentic disciple, I had to pray for him and do sufficient
conditions of devotion on his behalf to motivate him to become such a disciple.

In such a case, three levels of relationships are created: me, you and the local members. First, there must
be unity between you and me; then you should bring unity among the local members and yourself. Why
three levels? It is because originally God and Adam should have been united and then Adam and his sons
should have been united. That is a principle. Without reaching perfection through three stages, the realm
of perfection of the four-position foundation cannot appear. That is why you have to create others like
yourself. (096-285, 1978/02/13)

6. If someone says even one word that touches my heart, I might burst into tears. I have such a heart.
There is something in my heart that makes me choke up whenever I think of God. I cannot help this.
Since I have such a quality within myself, my life itself is prayer even when I do not pray in a formal
way. That is why I always feel God's sorrowful and suffering heart, and why I sometimes fall down,
choked with emotion, or grab hold of a tree or a telephone pole while my tears flow uncontrollably. At
those times I feel God's heart so intensely that I can no longer stand upright.

When I looked into it, I realized that something happened to God that made Him extremely sad. When I
prayed about it, He let me know what happened and where. Since I have the mission of the person with
the central responsibility on earth to make a foundation of heart, and to deal with both spiritual and
physical issues required to make this foundation, God always lets me know His actual situation. (060-219,
1972/08/17)

7. There was a time when even beggars told each other that they should not go to the Unification Church
because the food we offered them was so meager. Yet, we moved up from the bottom step by step.

In the early days I did not even celebrate my birthday. I thought, how many people have died never able
to celebrate their birthday while on earth? That is why I fasted on my birthday for three years, to
sympathize with them and to connect with them when I meet them in the spirit world.

Also, in the early days I did not wear a suit and tie when I spoke from the pulpit on Sundays. I began my
ministry wearing laborer's clothes. Whenever I spoke, whether a sermon or lecture, I invested my sweat
and tears, offering my utmost sincerity, even if only one person was listening. I did not treat people as
guests who were just passing by. I now miss those early days. (141-056, 1986/02/16)

8. Throughout my life, I invested everything I had to witness to people. When a patient comes to see a
doctor at the hospital, the doctor has the responsibility and obligation to invest his life for that patient,


even forgetting to sleep. Likewise, in raising the church members I forgot about whether it was day or
night. I often ate breakfast thinking I was eating dinner. There is such a tradition in the history of our
church.

When you are witnessing, create an environment in which even nature desires to praise you, in which the
water in the river wants to stop flowing to praise you and the fish in the river want to be on your table so
you can eat them. Then the people who eat those fish will start responding to you. This is the kind of
foundation you should leave behind.

Go around the area you are responsible for 10 or even 100 times. Visit every single house without
exception. God goes around the world 1,000 or even 10,0 00 times searching for His children. How can
you become God's sons and daughters and inherit from Him unless you do the same? So in every town
you visit, you should want to go around to all the houses in the area 1 00 and even 1,000 times, and when
you are unable to do so, you should repent in tears. As a leader responsible for the heart and spirit of
others, you need to do that. That is the way of a representative of the vertical True Parent and the
horizontal True Parents. Continue in this way, and your members will take the proper direction without
any deviation, find their position, and follow your example. (220-305, 1991/10/20)

9. In 1957, I prayed individually for about 4 00 members every day. These days I no longer pray like that.
However, in those days I needed to pray for them in order to help them transcend a certain level. When I
prayed, I could understand their individual spiritual situations. When I prayed, God would teach me
because the members were connected to me like branches.

You too should pray for your members, offering your utmost devotion. When you pray for them, if any of
them is spiritually injured, God will show you glimpses of their spiritual situations in all kinds of forms:
they might be downcast, or have their face covered with a cloth, and so on. When good things are
happening to them, you will see them smiling; when they are sad, you will see them with a sad
appearance. (070-181, 1974/02/09)

10. Always take the time to offer sincere devotions, prayers and other conditions. Offer them when you
get up at dawn, when you are on the borderline between the spiritual world and the physical world and
your optic nerves are just starting to function after a restful night. The spirit world will show you
something spiritual. Through such experiences, you will be given foreknowledge. Then you will be able
to predict, "Today this or that will happen in the church," or "today such and such a person will come."

A capable doctor can tell what kind of illness their patients have just by looking at their complexion, or by
seeing how their patients walk. Likewise, your spiritual antenna must be long and have the sensitivity to
appraise things. For this to happen, you need to offer conditions of devotion.

Prayer is truly powerful. Prayer allows you to be in complete control of your environment without having
to say a single word. Before I go somewhere, I always pray for 24 hours focused on my goal. I pray even
while I am eating and resting. I do not pray for my own sake; I pray for the sake of humanity and for God.

Once after I offered such prayers with a single resolve, I visited all our churches throughout the nation.
By doing so I brought the churches into a sphere of equilibrium. My prayers elevated the churches into a
realm under heavens sovereignty, where conscientious people could be pulled to them. That is why when
they met you, they were drawn to you without knowing the reason. That is why I say that you always
need to offer conditions of devotion. (207-349, 1990/11/11)

A church with fervor and love

```
In the 1950s, True Father personally guided members with zeal and passion. He listened to
members' stories all the way to the end, even late into the night, and then gave them guidance.
When he stood at the pulpit, he preached with tears. Because of this, the members always longed
for him and visited the church to see him. Once they came they could not tear themselves away to
go back home. In such an atmosphere filled with truth, love and the divine spirit, the church
overcame hardships and established a firm foothold for the next stage.
```
11. The most enjoyable time in my life was when I was personally raising members. I spent time with
them until late at night. Even though some members wanted to leave after midnight, I continued speaking
because I was immersed in the joy of helping them grow. I would speak to them until 1:00, 2:00, even
3:00 a.m., even as some of the members dozed off.

How different it was then than it is today. The time did not matter; I was so intoxicated with giving advice
and encouragement. As I spoke I was often in tears. I was thankful and I was deep in thought. Once I gave
them an injection of truth, even those who were on the way to hell would turn around and come back.
How exhilarating! Since heaven was with us, a huge electric current was present. A strong power like a
100,000-volt current flowed in us, and we could feel it shaking the entire world. What a delight! After


experiencing it, I could not fall asleep even if I tried. Even while sleeping, my eyes would suddenly open
wide. (167-329, 1987/08/20)

12. How much effort have you made to save people, representing God's heart and His role as Creator?
This is a serious issue. I have given so many lectures and sermons. In the 1950s in particular, there was
not a single day when I did not speak while shedding tears. There was not a single day that I did not cry
out in tears. Heaven consoled me and worked with me even as I kept my resolve to move forward, even
though those times when I collapsed on the verge of death, shedding so much blood and sweat that I was
about to lose consciousness.

Whenever you witness, pray for the people in your area. Pray for them every night before you go to bed.
If you are responsible for a district, go up to the highest mountain in the area and pray for the people
there. If you cannot do so, go down to the deepest valley and pray there. Don't stop praying. Afterward,
go to the holiest place, the church sanctuary, and pray there. Do not let the church sanctuary remain dry
without tears. (172-196, 1988/01/21)

13. What remains in history is not ability, but results, not the preparation, but the foundation we lay. This
is true; these are not simply my own words. It applies at school and anywhere.

So when you speak, do not just speak words. You have to live by your words and bring your own result;
then your words carry weight. When you lecture, you must touch the hearts of your listeners by
connecting your words to experiences that bring forth tears.

In the early days of our church, I gave sermons with my blood and tears amid harsh persecution. I
invested all my heart and soul, speaking at the top of my lungs in order to touch the hearts of my
congregation. I did this even though the persecution grew more and more each day. We still had a long
way to go, and I had to invest my whole being to keep the members on the path. It was exhausting, but I
gave them all the energy I had. I led the members that way because we had to bring results. (133-232,
1984/07/19)

14. In 1957 and 1958, what kind of person was I? I was a great listener who patiently heard the stories of
every member, young or old, who wanted to share with me. People recognized me as someone who would
listen to their stories, perhaps better than anyone else in Korea. When elderly ladies came to see me, they
would talk about their marriage life from their wedding day, even telling me exactly how they loved their
husbands. They shared everything they kept in their hearts. Anyone who came to see me said, "Father
listens to all my stories."

When they had nothing left to say, I started to speak. If you want to fill a bowl with something new, first
you have to turn it upside down so that everything is emptied out.

That is why I listened to them, putting myself in the position of enjoying what they had to say more than
anyone else, even staying up all night to hear it. It is all about genuinely listening to others and then
genuinely talking to them. That is the secret. That is how you give and receive. (096-322, 1978/02/13)

15. When I was doing my outreach work, I treated even an 80-year-old woman who visited me with the
same regard as I gave to young people in the prime of life. Is there anyone in heaven or on earth who
wouldn't like to be treated with such a heart?

So if such a woman comes to you, welcome her, rejoicing as if she were your ancestor come back to life.
Welcome her more than you would your own grandmother. Your ancestors cannot come from the spirit
world unless you make such conditions with other elderly people. Therefore, you should treat them with
such heart. It is heavenly law that you must treat elderly ladies well. To treat the elderly well is like
building a bridge according to the order of heaven. In fact, the oldest grandfather is God. (047-321,
1971/08/30)

16. The members who followed me in those days built a deep bond of heart with me, and many shed tears
whenever they thought of me. Even though they had their children, grandchildren and spouse, they still
shed tears when thinking of me. You also have to be like that. When I had something to eat, I kept the
food and waited until I could eat it with them. I only wanted to bring them joy by helping them with their
difficulties and uplifting them whenever they seemed down. That is why, when they faced persecution
from their villages, and even from the nation, they still followed me. In the early days of the church, we
lived in such an atmosphere.

Once new members joined the church, they wanted to see their spiritual parents and came to the church to
see them every day. That was the atmosphere then. I told the members to create such an environment in
order to guide their spiritual children. I also educated the new members to do the same. So, to them our
church was better than their home, their school or their workplace, and they preferred to come to our
church. That became a problem for society. (096-144, 1978/01/03)


17. In the early days of the church, the female members were dying to come to the church. Their hearts
kept shouting, "I want to go!" I could hear their inner voices. When I began listening to them, they began
speaking in the language of another world. They entered into a spiritual state of mind. If I liken God's
love to electricity, it was just like they were connected to that love through an electric cable.

Once they entered that state, they could see things in spirit. Even while at home, they knew what I was
doing at any given time. They knew specific things like, "Today Father is not in a good mood, so I'd
better not go to the church," and they tried to stay away from me. Yet even with that determination, they
still could not help but come to the church.

The Cheongpa-dong Church is on a hillside, and that hill had spiritual power to attract people. Who can
block the magnetic needle of a compass from pointing south and north? Even if they were determined not
to come to the church, they would soon find themselves leaving their room and walking around in circles
in the courtyard of their home. Finally they would open the gate, catch a bus and arrive at the church,
despite themselves. The Unification Church on that hill had such mysterious power. If you have never had
such experiences, you do not yet know true love. (166-228, 1987/06/07)

18. Unification Church members in those days were the most miserable people. They were persecuted and
chased out. I know members who were kicked out of their own homes on cold, snowy winter nights.
Having nowhere to go, all they could do was keep on praying and try to keep themselves warm by leaning
against the wall of a neighbor's house.

My heart was filled with bitterness and sorrow over how they were mistreated, but because I knew that
heaven endured such hardships again and again, I forgave their families who opposed them. I did this
because the families did not know what they were doing. Truly, I have gone through so many situations
and have so many stories to tell. Yet, who knew that I lived with the indescribably bitter sorrow of heaven
and earth within my heart? While walking this path, I swallowed countless tears. (157-138, 1967/04/02)

Continuous teaching

```
In the early days of the church, former church president Eu Hyo-won single-handedly undertook
the task of giving Divine Principle lectures to the guests who were witnessed to. Newcomers
listened to his lectures in the evenings, and people who came to hear three days of lectures
usually slept at the church during the time that they listened to the lectures. It was as if they were
attending a three-day workshop. President Eu set the record, giving lectures for 18 hours in a
single day.
```
```
He could not stand up due to the condition of his legs, so he gave his lectures while half-lying on
the floor, propping himself up with one arm and writing on rough printing paper. After President
Eu finished his lecture, True Father would speak to the guests. He spoke with all of his heart and
strength, until his whole body was soaked in sweat. Those who went through this process were
moved and touched by the profound truth of the Principle. From this experience alone they
resolved to walk the path of the Will.
```
```
Later, President Eu gave introductory lectures in the mornings and afternoons as well.
```
19. For three years and eight months President Eu Hyo-won gave lectures without taking a break for even
one day. This is the historical reality of our church. He gave the lectures despite his disability. When I
think of how I pushed him to lecture, I feel as though I am a merciless person. In those days we did not
have many members like we do now. When we had one new guest, he would give lectures just for that
person, and when we had no guests, he gave lectures to the members. I am sure there are many members
who remember this. (172-047, 1988/01/07)
20. I did not rest while President Eu Hyo-won was giving lectures. Sitting in my upstairs room, I listened
to all his lectures. I was given reports about who had come. In the evening I came down to give lectures
myself. Less than a minute after I started speaking, I would see him doze off from fatigue. Then I would
pray for him in tears. We experienced such a tearful history together.

The history of the Unification Church is so painful. Why did I have to do that? Why did President Eu
have to do that? It was for God. Nevertheless, the spirit world supported us. If it hadn't, it would have
meant that the spirit world does not exist. (107-249, 1980/05/19)

21. Even if there is no one at the church when you are giving a sermon, keep the door open and preach
while wailing in tears. Then, your neighbors will come and ask what is happening. People will come to
see what is going on. Then you can ask them to listen to your sermon.

You should speak with tears. For whom do you shed tears? You do it for the nation, for humankind, for


the world and for God. That is the way that you must go. If you collapse while giving lectures on the
Word, I will take care of you; if you die from that, I will hold the funeral for you. You will have things to
say when you go to the spirit world. You can say you were following my instruction, and while giving
lectures, speaking at the top of your lungs, you died.

How serious it is to give lectures on the Word! Do it as a matter of life and death. That was the attitude I
had. As a result, God helped me, and I now have become a worldwide figure. (107-248, 1980/05/19)

22. After you come out of a seven-day workshop at the Unification Church and walk the streets of the
city, you feel as if there is something different about the world. The trains look as if they are out of an
ancient legend, and every bus going down the street seems to be upside down. Even the people may seem
to be walking backward.

After having such an experience, would you stop coming to the church because you were told not to? In
the early days, even if our main gate was locked, members climbed over the church fence. When I told
them not to come and chased them out through the front door, they turned around and came in through the
back door. It was common for members to stay up all night praying, weeping and crying out in tears.

We need such a spirit at the church. Then something great will erupt like a volcano. In order to make this
happen, you have to give lectures day and night. That is why I asked President Eu to give lectures for as
much as 18 hours a day, which he did for three years and eight months. (107-244, 1980/05/19)

Section 4. Pioneer Outreach to 120 Areas

Forty-day pioneering

```
Beginning July 1, 1957, the members fasted for seven days together with True Father, who
continued this fast for a total of 40 days. Then, beginning on July 20 he dispatched the members
in two-member missionary teams for a 40-day pioneer outreach campaign in 120 areas
throughout Korea. Through this full-scale outreach activity, membership increased and new local
churches were established. In 1958 Father further strengthened the system of outreach. In 1959
headquarters organized three different 40-day workshops to train evangelists. Later, 40-day
Divine Principle workshops were held regularly as part of the work to raise up leaders.
```
1. How are we to live when carrying out God's Will? You cannot live just for yourself and be concerned
only with solving your own personal problems. You need to go beyond that and be concerned with the
problems of the whole. You must make a pure offering of eternal value. Engage in providential activity as
an evangelist of heaven. If you feel called for this mission and go out to witness, God will be with you. If
you live with this heart, the historical re-creation of love will surely take place. (002-014, 1957/01/06)
2. A special 40-day outreach campaign started on July 20, 1957. All the members in Korea began a seven-
day fast on July 1. Through fasting they made a new start. I fasted with them and announced this special
40-day campaign.

In the Unification Church, we hold a 40-day witnessing campaign starting on July 20 every year. This is
during the school break, the hottest time of the year. We need to sweat and work intensely for the
providence during the hottest period of the year. This is a good way to pay indemnity. Indemnity
conditions have to be set strategically. That was why I chose this most difficult time for witnessing.

When you go out witnessing, you are not to carry any money with you. If you have money, you should
give it away. You have to go to your assigned area and meet your expenses by doing manual labor or
whatever jobs you can do that will help the people in your area. By shedding your blood and sweat in
activities to help the people, you are undergoing training. (167-240, 1987/07/19)

3. In 1957, when the Unification Church started its outreach activities for the first time, I sent
missionaries out to 120 locations throughout Korea. I instructed them to go to their assigned areas with
only two changes of clothes and enough money for a one-way trip. It was during my 40-day fast, and I
encouraged them to do a limited fast, such as a liquid fast with a drink made from mixed grain powder. I
said they had to start by doing manual labor for their food, then later they could accept the food that
people offered them. This is what they did, starting from the lowest position of having nothing and
overcoming.

I too went this path. For three years I fasted on my birthday. I ate sitting on the floor, setting my food on a
newspaper as if it were a dining table. I ate only a bowl of grains with no more than three side-dishes,
including kimchi and soy sauce. This was how we climbed up through all the stages. This is restoration
through indemnity. Even the clothes I wore were hand-me-downs. (125-126, 1983/03/14)

4. When the members left to begin the 40-day outreach campaign, they did not complain or ask for


money. Even though they were persecuted in their areas, they went from house to house to save even one
more soul. As they went around early in the morning, all the dogs in the village barked at them. That
irritated the villagers, so they would not give our members any work there to earn money. That is why
they had to take a bus early in the morning and work far away.

With the money they made from their labor, they bought puffed rice. Then they offered that as a snack to
guests before giving lectures. You need to know that practices like these are recorded as part of the
providential history of the early days of the church. (215-043, 1991/02/06)

5. During the outreach campaign that we held in 1957, there were memorable moments. When members
ran into each other on the street, they were so happy. They shed tears when they said their goodbyes,
hating to separate from each other and looking forward to meeting each other again. This was also the
bond that members created with their spiritual children, with whom they spent many hours walking along
mountain ridges together. When they had to separate, they were so sad to have to say goodbye to each
other.

You cannot buy such moments, not with any amount of gold. Do you feel how priceless they are? If you
forget such memories, what do you think will be precious in your life? In the future, you must accompany
me not only in Korea but throughout the world, implanting my new teaching and introducing the heavenly
tradition. That will be the source of your pride. Yet, when can you make and collect the precious stories
and teaching materials that you will need to share in order to do this work? There is no better time than
now. (051-272, 1971/11/28)

6. Throughout the 1950s, even before the Unification Church was officially launched, I gave members all
kinds of training. I directed them to fast, go pioneering, and much more. In those days members missed
me very deeply. They came to the church to see me, staying late into the evening. I would walk with them
to their homes, but even then we could not say goodbye and ended up walking back to the church
together. Sometimes we spent all night like that, coming and going. And it was not only with me; the
members did the same with each other.

In those days in Korea, we did not have many vehicles like we do today. Most people walked. On many
occasions as we walked home in the moonlight or at dawn, we shed tears with burning desire and
determination, pledging to live for the nation, the world and heaven. I have many unforgettable memories
of those times. They were circumstances that taught us the real meaning of patriotism, of putting the
nation ahead of one's family. The high spiritual atmosphere moved us in those days. It was stronger than
one's first love in the secular world. I will always remember that time.

As church leaders, it is your responsibility to maintain that atmosphere. It has to be one of the goals of
your activities. Make effort to maintain the standard that connects your church to this foundational
tradition. Understand how I established this tradition and teach your successor how to inherit it. Even if
you are doing well now, if your successor cannot do better than you are doing today, the Unification
Church will decline. The future must always be better than today. Always keep in mind that you need to
invest yourself into the members now, for the sake of the future. (184-112, 1988/12/20)

7. It is not enough for you leaders to just speak or lecture about the Word. More importantly, you have to
be able to plant the Word so that it yields a harvest. You cannot harvest these fruits in an instant. It takes
more than three years. That is a principle. That is why you need to work hard for three years.

Hence, in 1957 I chose 120 locations for witnessing activities and sent our members there as missionaries,
saying, "Go with the attitude that this 40-day assignment to your area will continue for three years. Take
the position of servants. Be loyal to the people you meet in your village, and work for them as hard as you
would if they were paying you to work as an employee. This is how you can teach them the way of
loyalty. Don't just talk about loyalty, but demonstrate it through your actions. Then, even if you do not
say anything, other people will contribute to keep the work going after you have left. When people begin
to respond this way, your work can truly take root in that village." (029-194, 1970/02/28)

Witnessing atmosphere

```
When True Father dispatched witnessing teams to all parts of Korea, he allowed them to take
only two changes of clothes and only enough money for a one-way fare. Not only that, he also
instructed them not to eat anything other than steamed barley rice. Members who went witnessing
survived on a drink made from mixed grain powder dissolved in water. Sometimes they even ate
the scraps and bones that were to be fed to dogs. They carried out their pioneering work in the
most miserable conditions possible. In those days, a day's wages were not enough to buy even one
meal. At times these members, suffering from hunger, stumbled on the road.
```
```
They could not even say that they were from the Unification Church. Instead they woke up early
in the morning and swept the village streets or helped the villagers in their fields. That is how
```

```
they made connections with them. In the early days, our members sacrificed and abandoned
everything when they joined the church. This resulted in intense opposition from their family,
neighbors and friends in the secular world.
```
```
Beginning in 1960, members carried out witnessing activities on the streets of all the cities across
Korea, as well as in the major parks in downtown Seoul.
```
8. All of us, young and old, have been waging bloody battles to this day. Many trials have blocked our
path, but we overcame them by focusing only on God's Will. We did not have decent food to eat or fine
clothes to wear. We put everything into our struggle, shedding blood, sweat, and tears to lay the
foundation for victory.

When you started out on your first three-year course, I asked you to go the path of a repentant sinner. In
those years, we who were not sinners walked the path as if we were sinners. I know how hard you fought
to protect your area from being taken away by Satan, and how you would not retreat. I know some of you
sold your blood for money to protect your assigned area. You worked hard in limited circumstances.
However, there was also incredible spiritual effort behind the scenes to support you. Your toil prepared
you for the future, and it is a foundation for advancing toward a new world. (012-270, 1963/06/20)

9. When the Unification Church started witnessing for the first time, the members did not have to witness
with words. People were witnessed to through their dreams. In dreams, people were told, "Go to the
Unification Church!" When people did not follow the direction given in their dreams, they were hit with a
bat. The spirit world witnessed to many members this way. Ancestors said to their descendants, "If you go
to such and such a place, you will meet a person called Mr. Moon." This was how witnessing occurred.
When people resisted, their ancestors kept pushing them and driving them until they went to that place.
This was how the members of the Unification Church were gathered. (049-201, 1971/10/10)
10. During the early days of witnessing, persecution was severe and people who went out to do outreach
were extremely lonely. Members had no way of knowing each other's situations and yet they really
wanted to stay in touch with each other. Eventually, some would find a high school or college student
who would link them together and through them, they could pass messages back and forth to arrange a
meeting.

The members' areas were some 20 to 40 kilometers apart, so they would make an appointment to meet at
a point midway between them. They would choose a landmark that was easy to find, for example at the
crossroads, under a bridge, or at a monument. When they met, did they have anything to eat? Normally
when two friends meet after a long time, they eat lunch or dinner together, but these members could not
enjoy that luxury.

The members were as close as any brother or sister could get. Who can describe the aching hearts they
carried back then? They were not able to express their love and heart toward their own parents or siblings.
So they would invest themselves for each other. One of them might resolve, "The next time we meet, I
will definitely treat you to a chicken lunch." Then, to raise money to buy that lunch, the member would
work for one whole week. But he or she would not say how the money was earned.

Later, when those who were treated to a meal learned about the hard work their brothers or sisters had
done, they felt as if their bones were melting. Generally we try to keep our composure, but when we are
about to cry our chins tremble first and finally we burst into tears. It was like that. From that time on,
whenever they met each other, they did not need to speak words. They just hugged each other and prayed
for God's Will while crying their hearts out. You cannot imagine how loudly they wailed. They prayed in
tears, paying no heed to the local people who might be staring at them. All those experiences became their
personal history, which they could share later. (215-043, 1991/02/06)

11. When the members of our church were doing outreach in their pioneering areas throughout Korea,
they would work all day long and barely earn enough for one meal. Sometimes even young members
would be so hungry that their legs would buckle as they walked.

The members did not receive any money from our headquarters. They needed to make money to eat.
However, if they had worked in their area, the townspeople would have accused the church, saying, "The
Unification Church does not even take care of their own members." If such a rumor had spread, the
members and the church would have been persecuted even more. So they had to go to another town as far
away as 40 kilometers, work there and then return. Many members did that, but they never spoke about it.
Six months or a year later, when the students they were witnessing to came to know the situation of our
missionaries, they burst into tears. Then they started to give them lunch boxes.

Yet for the older pioneering members, to eat the lunch offered by these pure-hearted students made them
feel miserable in their hearts. It was painful for the pioneers to have to rely on these young students for
food, and make them skip meals, when in fact they felt responsible to take care of the students. Under


these circumstances, the pioneers and the students helped each other overcome their difficulties, and with
the determination, "Let's realize God's Will, even if we die," their hearts connected. (094-229,
1977/10/01)

12. We have the Sung Hwa Student Association, made up of junior high school and high school students
who gave food to our missionaries. When their parents severely opposed this, they began to take turns
giving them food. Thus, if there were 30 students, each of them would give up their lunch only once every
ten days. In this way the missionaries could eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. This was their contribution to
support our witnessing activities. When their parents realized what was going on, they were upset. Even
so, we had to use this means to move forward. Those lunches were the students' offering to the
missionaries who were serving God's Will for the nation and the world. To this very day, those former
students praise those glorious days when they could make such an offering. (215-042, 1991/02/06)
13. Before those students joined the Unification Church they used to have good lunch boxes, better than
other students. But after they joined the church, instead of taking their lunch, they would hide themselves
away on the school grounds, walk around, and then come back to class. Their classmates figured out what
they were doing, and when their parents found out, it made big problems. This did not happen just once or
twice. Some of them were constantly skipping lunch, so their classmates told their mother, "Your child
brought lunch boxes before but now that they have joined the Unification Church, they do not have them.
Why are you not making lunch for them?" Then their parents would say to their children, "I heard you did
not eat your lunch at school. What happened?" Then the students had to admit they had given their lunch
to the missionaries, which caused the parents to oppose our church even more severely. This happened
often all over Korea. Christians would oppose us especially severely, saying that a pack of wolves had
come to steal God's sheep. How do you think I felt as their leader, having placed the missionaries in that
situation? (094-230, 1977/10/01)
14. We have been walking a suffering path to remove the nation's wall of bitter pain that has blocked us in
external areas. I want to dissolve this bitterness of the people of Korea. Also, I know the Will of God.
Therefore I willingly and gladly accept any kind of hardship. If someone asks, "Who shed the most blood
and sweat, and who embraced God's heart and offered loyalty to Him?" we are the ones who can
confidently assert that we have the truth and have offered conditions of devotion centered on God. That is
why I am saying that we are the only ones who can receive the heavenly fortune that is coming. (035-311,
1970/10/30)

Section 5. Missions to Japan and the United States

Overseas missionaries

```
After outreach work in Korea began to take root through the 40-day witnessing campaigns, True
Father was able to turn his attention to other countries. In 1956, the year after his incarceration
in Seoul's Seodaemun Prison, Father offered prayers at Gapsa Temple, a famous Buddhist temple
on Mt. Gyeryong in South Chungcheong Province. While praying, he sensed that Japan would
soon once again be in a very important position in Asia. Because the Soviet Union and China
were supporting North Korea, Father knew that if Japan stood on the side of communism, Korea
would be seriously endangered. Hence, he realized that he needed to send missionaries to Japan
to begin to deal with this potential threat. By loving Japan, formerly the enemy of Korea, he
would establish it as an object-partner nation on God's side. Herein lay the reason he sent
missionaries to Japan, despite the difficult circumstances.
```
```
At the same time, he also determined to send missionaries to the United States, which was in the
same position as Rome at the time of Jesus. He planned to establish the United States as the
central nation in his worldwide mission work.
```
1. I have truly attended people with the same devotion as I would show if I were attending my own father
and mother. Furthermore, in order to make a foundation to restore the society and nation, I have done the
same for people I do not even know. According to this principle, I cannot worry only about my own
country. Even under the most severe persecution, my prayers and interests were not for Korea alone. I
also had to work hard to send missionaries to Japan and America.

When I sent the first missionary to Japan, there were no diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan.
Unable to go through any normal entry procedures, this missionary had to be smuggled into Japan on a
small boat. As for America, you cannot imagine how hard it was to send even one missionary there. No
one could imagine that we could send missionaries to America at the time. Even under such difficult
circumstances, I decided to send someone to America to sow the seed of the Principle. I worked day and
night to make this happen. The principle of providential restoration works from the outside in. For a
country to receive glorious blessings from God, I needed to create a situation whereby the providential
Will would come into that country from the outside. (015-072, 1965/02/13)


2. When the Unification Church attempted to register as a church in Korea, there was a big struggle in the
government. That was in 1963. I knew that such a day would come, so in the late 1950s I made a
condition before heaven to prepare for it. This is why I sent out foreign missionaries. I prepared, knowing
that if Abel is constrained Cain can lead the course of restoration through indemnity.

Long ago, Cain killed Abel, but now we could form a Cain-type altar based in foreign nations in order to
support and save the Abel-type altar. In order to make such unseen connections between countries in
different parts of the world, even though we were chased and beleaguered, we sent missionaries abroad.
Taking a serious risk, we sent three people to America and one to Japan.

In Korea, the Unification Church grew despite opposition from the Liberal Party of Syngman Rhee,
which controlled the government. That regime thought we would disappear. They never imagined we
would prosper as much as we did. Behind this growth, however, there is a history filled with bloodshed.
There are so many stories that defy imagination. I anticipated opposition on the national level, so I had to
make internal preparations to deal with it. The condition I made was to send missionaries to America,
Japan and even Germany. (016-064, 1965/12/26)

3. We need a strategy to do world-level work. The mess that the world is in has to be straightened out
centering on True Parents. In order to go through the course of restoration through indemnity on the world
level, we have to fulfill our portion of responsibility. Having established a national foundation through the
40-day outreach campaigns throughout Korea, we sent missionaries to countries around the world.

We built our foundation in Korea, which is like Israel in Jesus' day, and then we went on to build a
foundation in America, which is the center of the world, much as Rome was in Jesus' day. Our situation is
different from that of Jesus, who was beleaguered by the religious leaders and people and bore their
persecution. You know how the things I spoke about for the last few years have turned out. It would be an
honor if we could die fighting against billions of evil spirits and have our bodies buried in the land of
Canaan. (013-212, 1964/03/15)

4. We have to accomplish the mission, not only for Korea but for the world. In order to develop the
Unification Church, I had to send missionaries to Japan and America even while being persecuted by the
Liberal Party of Korea. Unlike today, in those days the Korean government opposed and persecuted us.
So I sent a missionary to Japan on a smuggler's boat. But I did not feel any guilt about that at all. This is
because I looked at the situation from the perspective of God's providence. If I had not done that, we
could never have made the victorious foundation we have today. (019-141, 1968/01/01)
5. In order to save Korea, and then Japan and the world, I needed to find a way for our strong religious
teachings and philosophy to be adopted by the people living in the major cultural centers of Japan. The
question was how we could educate the Japanese people and establish ourselves in the subject position, as
opposed to going there and being condemned. I believed that this was the only way Korea and Japan
could overcome communism. The young missionary who went to Japan and lived there in hiding
pioneered the Unification Church and established that new foundation.

In Japan, we focused more on making inroads with Japanese leadership than on creating a nationwide
movement. Somehow we had to connect Japan and America to Korea. The Japanese Unification Church
began in this way, with the purpose of influencing Japan. (110-167, 1980/11/17)

Japan

```
In the early morning of May 30, 1958, in a garden in the pine woods behind the Gapsa Temple on
Mt. Gyeryong, True Father spoke for the better part of two hours with Choi Bong-chun (Choi
Sang-ik). He then decided to send Mr. Choi as a missionary to Japan. Father made this decision
out of his overwhelming love for Japan; he was determined to save that country.
```
```
Missionary Choi left Busan on July 15, 1958. After traveling for some time, he arrived at the port
city of Hiroshima with a heart full of expectation and deep emotion. Upon his arrival, the
Japanese authorities arrested him over his immigration status. He had to go through suffering
and innumerable hardships before he could finally arrive in Tokyo and begin to propagate the
Word. His method included handing out leaflets with the name "Tokyo Church of the Holy Spirit
Association for the Unification of World Christianity." He soon found new members. The first
church service was held at 85 Nichome, Totsukacho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, on October 2, 1959. Thus
the Japanese HSA-UWC was born.
```
6. If I look at Japan from my own point of view, it is my enemy. I was tortured many times under
Japanese rule. But God commands us not to strike our enemy. Rather, if the enemy does not have clothes
or is starving, He says to take care of him. This is why I sent Choi Bong-chun as a missionary to Japan. I
knew that the whole of Japan and Korea was against us. But I also knew that in a few decades, it would
become clear that this work was for their benefit. I knew that someday the people of both nations would


clasp their hands together in respect and thank me. So I sent him to Japan despite the costs and the risks.

The persecution directed against the Unification Church was at its peak, and it was during such a time that
I decided to send out Choi Bong-chun. Nobody understands the suffering we endured to send just one
person to Japan. We sent this missionary at a time when not one person could be spared, and we held back
our tears as he left. The achievement he made by putting his life on the line can never be erased from the
history of Japan. Now Korea is thankful to Reverend Moon.

God loves Japan. I love Japan more than anyone in the history of Japan. I love Japan more than the
Japanese themselves. If God loves Japan, I want to love Japan with a deeper heart than even the Japanese.
(1969/04/27)

7. Even though Japan is my enemy, I have loved that country more than anyone else has. Because of this,
Japan can respond as my object partner and work for God's Will throughout Asia in the future. Otherwise,
I would not be able to find a country to serve as an object partner to the subject partner country. Because
that is Japan's destiny, in a show of love for Japan stronger than anyone else's, I borrowed money to send
a missionary to Japan and thereby save Japan. (083-109, 1976/02/05)
8. In 1958 when we sent the first missionary to Japan, the Liberal Party of Korea was in power. It was
vehemently opposed to the normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan. What could I do to ensure
the survival of Korea? I knew that the Soviet Union and China were supporting North Korea and Kim Il-
sung. For certain we had to find a way into Japan. This is the reason I sent the missionary to Japan. At the
time, because diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea were not yet established, it was not easy to
send a Korean national into Japan to do missionary work. (110-167, 1980/11/17)
9. If we are trying to fulfill God's Will for the whole world, then we have a responsibility to do the same
for the neighboring nation of Japan and many other countries. Thus, we have to send out missionaries to
the world, even though we are still on a suffering path ourselves. We cannot wait until we have money to
spare. We have to do it under difficult circumstances. Thus it happened that when we pioneered Japan, we
borrowed money to send our missionary there. I did this because I knew I had to set the condition of
having loved the enemy nation of Japan more than any other person has ever loved it.

Upon the missionary's departure, I told him, "You must give everything you have to Japan in order to
save it." It seems like only yesterday that I sent this man off, telling him he had to go even at the cost of
his life. We did not even have enough money to make ends meet, yet I borrowed the money to send him.
At the time, no one could understand why I did this. The path of God's Will is difficult. It is not the path
of happy times, nor is it a smooth road over level ground. (032-307, 1970/07/26)

10. I said to a missionary going to Japan, "I will pray for you and set conditions for you. I will not sleep
until you arrive in Japan. Do not come back until you have completed your mission, even if it means
death." Upon arrival in Japan from Busan he was arrested and sent to Omura Prison. He was transferred
to several facilities until finally he was scheduled to be sent back to Korea. But he felt he simply could
not come back, even if it meant his death, since he had already risked his life to go there after I gave him
his ticket. While he was on the train to Shimonoseki, he thought of jumping from the train but it was too
fast and there were too many tunnels. So he arrived at the prison in Shimonoseki and waited to be sent
back to Korea. But he knew that if he was sent back to Korea, everything would be lost. So he used his
wits and started fasting. One week, then ten days of continual fasting eventually made him sick,
whereupon a doctor diagnosed him with heart disease. He was sent to a hospital for treatment, from which
he escaped. This is how he pioneered Japan and eventually trained many brave Unification Church
soldiers. (023-137, 1969/05/18)
11. I sent out a missionary to Japan. Heavenly fortune seeks you out when you go beyond manmade
systems and laws. Because I know how heavenly fortune works. I have to prepare accordingly, and that
generally means that my path is full of danger, pain and persecution. If you always please others, there
will not be any persecution. But when you are trying to do what is right for God, then you will be in
conflict with others, and if they are in authority they will obstruct you. Despite this, Unification Church
members are going heaven's way. (058-317, 1972/06/25)
12. When I sent the first missionary to Japan, I told him, "Love the Japanese people more than anyone
else does. Love them even while you are shedding tears and even when you are trapped in a corner. Love
them even while you are being chased out. Love them to such a degree that the evidence of it will force
them to testify to the fact that you loved them." When a foreigner demonstrates loyalty beyond the level
that Japanese people show to their own country, then the Japanese people have no choice but to bow their
heads before him. This is an ironclad rule. While following this rule, Missionary Choi was taken to
prison, but he managed to escape and started to witness. Some may think what he did was wrong from the
viewpoint of conventional behavior, but the Japanese people will remember it gratefully for years to
come. At the time, they may have opposed us and judged us negatively, but with the passage of time, their
descendants will embrace this phase of history tearfully and take it as a source of inspiration. (159-056,


## 1968/01/28)

The United States

```
On January 2, 1959 church members gathered with True Father at the Yeouido Airport to give a
send-off to the first missionary to the United States, Professor Young Oon Kim. She had been a
professor at Ehwa Woman's University until she was forced to resign in March 1955 for being a
Unification Church member.
```
```
When Professor Kim arrived in the United States, she found employment as a researcher at the
University of Oregon. However, she soon quit her job and began witnessing full-time, working as
an emissary of heaven. She wrote several Divine Principle books in English and delivered the
Principle teachings in places where people who were thirsting for new truth and spiritual
experiences gathered. Thanks to the devotion of True Parents and the hard work of Professor
Kim, on September 18, 1961, the American church received legal certification as a corporate
entity from the state of California under the name Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of
World Christianity. It was approved as a tax-exempt entity by the federal government in April
1963.
```
13. Because history advances through parallels, a Second Israel was bound to emerge. This is based on
spiritual truths. Today's Christianity is in the position of Judaism 2,0 00 years ago. Christianity gave birth
to democracy, and democracy carries the responsibility to realize a God-centered world.

Korea is in the same position as Israel, and America is in the same position as Rome. Korean Christianity
is in the position of internal Judaism, which represents the internal Israel, and is therefore the microcosm
of world Christianity. So Korea is in the position of the internal Israel. In much the same way as Israel
was a vassal state of Rome, Korea is influenced by American culture and economy.

Had the Korean people and Korean Christianity united with the Unification Church, I could have
indemnified the inability of Judaism to unite with Jesus during Jesus' time on earth. But because of
Korea's disbelief, the Unification Church was forced to go the path of Golgotha, just as Jesus did.
Nonetheless, we emerged victorious. Our official registration as a religion in America is the manifestation
of our victory in the struggle against Christian opposition. Now that we are a registered religion in
America, we can begin to establish the original family centered upon the four-position foundation. (013-
097, 1963/10/23)

14. We must quickly engage in worldwide mission work. But first, we have to start with America. Say
what you will, but when we look at the globe today, America is the center of the world. Economically,
politically, militarily, in every respect, America is the center. Of course, Europe pioneered the
advancement of western culture, but now it has yielded the leading role to America. When you talk to
young people in England, you can tell they yearn for America. British people have a conservative
personality and are proud of their country, but they envy America as the new leader, and they want to go
there.

It is the same with Germany and France. This sentiment is the same at all levels of society, but it is
especially prominent among the youth. They want to know how they can follow America's lead. Seeing
how everyone in western countries yearns for America, we can take this as clear evidence that America is
playing the leading role in the world. The question now is, how will America carry out its leading role?
(024-098, 1969/07/13)

15. Professor Young Oon Kim was sent to America as a missionary. One way she witnessed was to visit
spiritualists. She witnessed to them by saying, "Here, take this book and pray about it." What a creative
way to witness! She also told them, "Please pray about who Young Oon Kim is." If they prayed as she
asked them to, the spirit world would give them strict and precise directions, "When she enters the room,
stand up straight, honor her with a full bow, and follow her. She does not have much money, so give her
money." This is how the Unification Church of America began. (049-202, 1971/10/10)
16. I sent out missionaries to the East Coast and the West Coast, as well as the American Northwest. I
sent a man to the East Coast; a woman to the West Coast; and a man to the Northwest. The man sent to
the East Coast represented Adam, the woman sent to the West Coast represented Eve and the man sent to
the Northwest represented the archangel.

Eve was the first to arrive in America. She had to come first to lay a path for Adam and the archangel, and
then to accomplish her mission, which was to unite the three of them. This is how I saw things. This is the
viewpoint of the Principle. Unless they united, it would not work. They could not influence the destiny of
America, the archangel nation, if they remained separate. During the tumultuous 1960s, I sent these
missionaries to America to accomplish this providence. (067-256, 1973/07/01)


17. It is time for America to wake up. The sun must rise anew in America. You must take responsibility
for every state in the nation. Your activities must spread from this state into other states. Even though
there are not many of you, you must each be responsible to accomplish this task. Something terrible may
happen if you do not fulfill this responsibility. If you cannot fulfill your task, then America, which is in
the Abel position, will face significant difficulties from the governments of the communist nations, which
are in the Cain position. The free world will come under attack. But if you fulfill your responsibilities,
you will save democracy and secure its freedom. (015-073, 1965/02/13)
