### Section 2. A New Beginning in Busan Refugee life
Upon arriving at Heukseok-dong, Seoul, True Father found his way to the home of Kwak No-pil,
a fellow believer with whom he had been close when they both attended the New Jesus Church in
Myeongsudae. Mr. Kwak, however, had already left for Busan. True Father unpacked his things
and stayed there for a few days.  
On December 30, 1950, after searching far and wide, he found the residence of his former
landlord Mrs. Lee Gi-bong and her family and met with them. They talked long into the night.
After he returned to Mr. Kwak's house early on the morning of December 31, the police came and
took him to the Heukseok-dong police substation for questioning. Earlier Kim Won-pil had been
called to the military recruiting station to possibly be drafted into the defense corps; now True
Father likewise had to go in for processing. He was given a physical checkup at the military field
base set up in the Changgyeong Palace.  
However, seeing True Father's short hair and hearing his explanation that he had come from
North Korea, the examiner gave him a class C exemption, because he was worried that if Father
were a spy or a deserter from the North Korean army, it might cost him his job. The result was
that True Father was exempt from military service. Kim Won-pil was also given the same
exemption. Both then returned to Mr. Kwak's house in Heukseok-dong, where they welcomed the
New Year. Two days later, with his exemption papers, True Father went to the police substation
and was issued a refugee ID.  
On January 3 the entire population of Seoul was ordered to evacuate the city because the South
Korean army would be starting its retreat the following day. True Father and his companions
joined the refugee trail once again and headed for Busan.

1. When I traveled to South Korea from North Korea, I had a shaved head. In those days, when you joined
the army they shaved your head. As I was young, when I came to South Korea I was supposed to enroll in
the army. New recruits would undergo their physical examinations at the Changgyeong Palace. I had been
released from prison not so long before then, but still I wasn't too skinny. As they were taking my medical
history, one of the officers asked me, "Where are you from?" In those days, people could not tell who was
a soldier and who was a spy. Because of my short hair, he thought I might be a spy. He knew that if he
sent a spy to the army, he could lose his job. So, after talking to me, he stamped my paper "third class,"
which meant I was exempt from military service. I carried this paper with me, and it was accepted
everywhere. That was the only identification I had. (187-218, 1989/02/11)

2. I underwent hardships, but they were not just ordinary ones. As we fled south, the North Korean army
was so close behind us that we could hear their shouts. Along the way we went through many dangerous
situations due to the presence of the Soviet, Chinese and North Korean armies. Finally we came to the
refugee area in Busan. Among the refugees, I believe we were the last ones to reach the area, arriving
right after the battle at the Nakdong River. The South Korean forces had made their last stand. My path as
a refugee was extremely difficult. There were many unforgettable stories.  
These were not just steps in my personal life but steps to heal the wounds of God's bitter sorrow by
paying indemnity for history. You must understand that from the very beginning I had already made up
my mind that I would not tread a comfortable path. I am not the kind of person who looks back to see if
there might have been another, easier, way.  
While living as a refugee I had no house; I slept outdoors on the grass or in the sandpits with the sky as
my blanket, watching the stars and shedding tears of bitter sorrow for the Korean Peninsula. (516-109,
2006/02/04)

3. It took 55 days for us to walk from Pyongyang to Busan. We begged for food along the way and,
interestingly, God knew very well when we were hungry and tired. He knew it. Once I thought, "The day
after tomorrow, we will get chicken." Then it happened that a lady came and greeted me, saying,
"Welcome." I asked, "Who are you? I do not know you." Then she said, "Last night, I had a dream of my
great-great-grandfather, who said that a noble guest would come and told me to prepare chicken and rice
cakes for him. So I did." I asked her, "How did you know what he would look like?" She said, "I was told
he would come as a shabby-looking passerby, and your face looks very similar to his." Can you believe
that such things happened? In that way, I was treated to rice cakes and chicken. These kinds of things
happened quite often. (153-089, 1963/10/18)

4. Those who followed me in North Korea were very enthusiastic people. They followed me day and
night wherever I went, meeting with whomever I met. But after I was imprisoned, most of them
disappeared. Even the most unforgettable among them drifted away. There was one person to whom I
wrote a heartfelt letter and had someone deliver it to him. But then, when I went to visit him, he had
already changed. He said, "If you are the Son of God, why did you end up in prison? Your teaching is all
false." He did not even care to read the letter. Instead he said, "Oh, a heretic is released from prison! Did
you come here to spread your heresy?" So I took the letter back.  
I was still carrying that letter with me when I passed through Yeongcheon, North Gyeongsang Province in
South Korea. There, as I was crossing a bridge beside the railroad tracks to go to Busan, I took out that
letter and read it one more time. Then I tore it up and threw it away. That was January 18, 1951. There
were so many unforgettable incidents like that.  
I already knew that even the most zealous among my followers could lose trust, betray me and leave.
When I was in prison, that man's spirit had come to me, greeted me, and in tears told me the story of his
situation, saying, "I am leaving you now." I had thought, "How can this be?" But, as I later discovered, it
was at that time that he left me. (170-016, 1987/11/01)

#### Father's suffering life as a refugee
Arriving at Choryang Station in Busan on January 27, 1951, True Father cooked rice in a butter
tin in the waiting room. He ate it with Kim Won-pil, and they spent their first night there. At the
time Busan was teeming with refugees. The next morning, they managed to find Kwak No-pil,
who had left his Busan address for them at his home in Heukseok-dong, Seoul before fleeing to
Busan ahead of them. They spent three days with him.  
Then on January 31, True Father unexpectedly met his friend Aum Duk-mun, with whom he had
studied in Japan. Aum Duk-mun would become a prominent architect and design the Se-jong
Center in Seoul. Mr. Aum insisted that True Father come and stay with him at his rented single
room in Bumin-dong. Reluctantly True Father went there and stayed for a while with Mr. Aum's
family of four -- himself, his wife, and their two children. After listening to True Father's words
for a week, Mr. Aum knelt down before him and confessed, "I can no longer regard you as simply
my friend; you are my teacher, a great saint and philosopher."  
In early April, True Father and Kim Won-pil went to live in a laborers' camp, which was nothing
but a cramped barracks behind Choryang Station. They stayed there for more than ten days. Then
they ran into Kim Won-deok, who had been one of True Father's followers in Hungnam Prison.
They stayed at his home in Goejeong-dong for about two weeks. For about four months, from
May to August, they resided at a boarding house located at the entrance of Beomnaetgol, which
before the liberation had been living quarters for employees of a Japanese-run electric company.
They also stayed at Pier Three in Busan Harbor for about half a month, working as porters.
Sometimes True Father had no choice but to sleep in a sunny spot in the woods or a bomb
shelter. Occasionally he even begged for food and laid down to rest under the eaves of strangers'
homes. Such was the tearful life he led as a refugee.

5. When I arrived in Busan, it was flooded with people; they were packed in like sardines. There were no
rooms available anywhere. In every trash can or empty box even, there would be two or three people
squeezed in. All the refugees who had fled from all over Korea gathered in Busan. It was like a melting
pot. There was no space even to put your foot down. Every village around Busan was overflowing with
people. Even when trying to just stand still, I would be jostled this way and that. That was my daily life.  
Having come to Busan, I had nothing to wear and nothing to eat. I had to make money, even a few
pennies, so I worked at various odd jobs. Even in those circumstances I was still able to start a new
church movement.  
I had no home of my own and it was February, so it was very cold. I worked on night shifts and came
back between 10:00 p.m. and midnight. It was very cold at night, so I would sleep curled up like a shrimp
and cover myself with a coat down to my knees. I still remember that experience. I asked a member to
keep that coat as a memento, but someone threw it away because it was old and tattered. If that coat had
been preserved so that you could see it today, you would shed tears. It was such a memorable coat. Living
like that, I walked step by step to lay the foundation we have today. (1974/05/12)

6. In those days, I often slept between two rocks on a hill during the warmest hours of the day, around
1:00 or 2:00 p.m., covering myself with a coat. Then, one rainy day around noontime, in front of the
Chohung Bank, I met a friend of mine from my school days named Aum Duk-mun. When I saw him, I
could not help but loudly shout out to him, so everyone turned around and stared at me. He said that he
never imagined he would see me again. He thought I had died in North Korea. As soon as we met, he
invited me into his home. I am still grateful for his act of kindness. There were too many refugees sitting
and resting under the eaves of people's houses at night. I can never forget how he took me to his house
and treated me well. (485-327, 2005/02/02)

7. After I came out of Hungnam Prison, it took me four long months to get to Busan. You cannot imagine
how dirty my clothes became. My clothes were so dirty that I wore them inside out. In Busan there was
nowhere to sleep. It was December and really cold, and I was wearing just one layer of clothing. When I
came to Busan, I tried to avoid the cold by working as a laborer at the military base near the harbor at
night. Working at night was easier than trying to sleep. During the day, I went into the hills around the
city to find a place to sleep in the forest and spend some time alone. (052-279, 1972/01/03)

8. When I was a refugee in Busan, I slept near the pier or on a hillside. It was interesting. In early
February when it was cold, I would lay down on my military coat and wrap myself up in it. Because it
was very cold, I worked during the night and slept during the day, from around 10: 00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. It
was good to sleep on the sunny side of the hill, sitting still and sleeping like a pheasant. After waking up
from sleep and straightening my clothes, I thought of Kim Sat-gat's poem "The Wanderer." When I had
money and wanted to eat porridge, I would go to the harbor near the wharves. There were women there
who sold red bean porridge that they cooked, covering their pots with a cloth to keep it warm as if they
were loving and caring for their babies. I would buy a bowl of porridge and eat it. In those days, those
porridge-sellers were my friends. (153-090, 1963/10/18)

#### The Beomil-dong mud-wall hut
In August 1951, True Father built a small, mud-wall hut on the side of Mt. Sujeong on the
outskirts of the village of Beomnaetgol. Its current address is 1513, Beomil 4-dong, Dong-gu,
Busan. All he had were earth and rocks to pile up on one another, so the structure collapsed
twice before he completed it on the third attempt. It consisted of just one room, less than six
square meters in area. It did not have a separate kitchen, just a hand-built stove outside against
one wall, on which he could place a pot. Near the stove there was a door, about one meter high
and situated right in the middle of the wall, so that one could pass through it only by stepping
high over the threshold and bending down almost double.  
The roof, constructed of cardboard ration boxes joined together, was too low for anyone to stand
upright. On sunny days you could see the sky through the roof, and on stormy day's rain poured
through the roof into the house. When it rained, a small spring gushed forth from one corner of
the room and the sound of water running beneath the house could be heard. The water that came
in through the chimney, built on the side facing the mountain, flowed through flues under the
floor and out through a fire hole. On the floor there were several layers of straw mats, over
which there were three to four layers of straw bags, and a long, wide sleeping pad was spread
out on top.  
In the latter half of 1951, Kim Won-pil worked at a job and True Father assisted him while
mainly concentrating on making internal preparations. Kim Won-pil left for work early in the
morning and returned late at night. He worked as a sign-painter on the military base, and as a
side job he drew portraits for American soldiers from photographs of their wives. Each portrait
earned him $4. He drew around ten portraits a day, and sometimes even 20 to 30 portraits on a
good day. At that time, True Father wrote Wolli Wonbon, Original Text of the Divine Principle.
At night he looked out over downtown Busan and in his mind he envisioned the future of the
providence. Every day in the early dawn he climbed up the hill and offered tearful prayers.

9. During my refugee days when I first came to Choryang, Busan, I was only 32 years old. I was quite
young and even more handsome than I am now. I used to work on Busanjin Pier 4. I remember the
women who sold red bean porridge and rice cakes at the harbor. I also remember the days when I wrote
Original Text of the Divine Principle in a small room at the laborers' barracks in Choryang. It was such a
small room, you could not lie down straight, except when you lay diagonally. And even when I lay down
diagonally, my feet touched the wall. (143-171, 1986/03/18)

10. During my time as a refugee in Busan, many people gathered around me. If I told them some
interesting stories, they would bring food to share with me. However, I could not just live like that so I
built a small hut. It was not much better than a doghouse. The walls and roof were made of mud and
stones, and it was a very humble place to live in. I did not even own a piece of land on which to build a
house, so I built the hut on a slope. After finishing it, I realized there was a small spring in the middle of
the floor. The roof was made of old cardboard boxes, and the one room was really small. I wore the same
ragged clothes for four months. I was in such wretched circumstances; nevertheless people who were
spiritually guided came looking for me. (052-279, 1972/01/03)

11. As I began my course in Busan, I built a small hut in Beomil-dong that was like a swallows nest. I
needed a shovel to build that hut. I tried to borrow one, but no one would lend one to me. Refugees try to
sell anything to make money, so people refused to lend me a shovel. I had to build a house, but I had no
shovel and no money. What could I do? I had to make do with a fire shovel. I also needed a pick-ax, but
since I did not have one, I prepared the foundation of the house with only a fire shovel. I tried to borrow a
mold to make bricks but I could not get one. So I went to the US military camp, brought back some empty
ration boxes, flattened them, put mud on top, and built a house. It took so much mud. In that way, I built a
house like a swallow's nest. (153-309, 1964/03/26)

12. Some of the people who were my followers in North Korea had moved to the South. They could not
forget me, so when they heard that I was in Busan, they came looking for me. We held Sunday services in
that small hut. The hut may have been small, but it became well-known.  
I had no land, so I built the hut by leveling a space on the side of a hill. No one bothered me about
digging on a hillside to build a house. When it rained, a spring of water gushed up in the room. How
wonderful that was! It was like the best, 21st century modern home. What could I do? I dug about a foot
deep into the ground and laid stones to make a drainage trough for the water. I made a way for the water
to drain out and put the ondol heater over it. So the spring water flowed under the ondol. It was such a
memorable house. (153-309, 1964/03/26)

13. On June 25, 1953, a ceasefire took effect. Shiploads of military goods from the United States filled the
harbor in Busan. I used to count the ships every morning. Before the ceasefire there were normally around
50, but sometimes there were more than 100. By looking at them, I could tell how the war was going. If
there was a large number of supply ships, I thought, "There is going to be a big battle." And if there were
fewer ships, I reckoned, "The war is going to continue at the same level." At that time I had just a few
followers. While I lived by myself in Beomil-dong, the people who became members were those who
were urged by the spirit world to come looking for me. I recall this as though it happened just yesterday.
(143-172, 1986/03/18)

14. In the past, when I lived as a refugee in Busan, there were times when I shed many tears. There was
no house in the world like mine. The house was built on a rock. There was a small table inside, and a
canvas for painting. The canvas was for the purpose of painting portraits for American soldiers who were
returning to their homes after fighting in the Korean War. These were the only two things inside. It was
an impoverished existence. I wore an American military jacket, brown with four pockets. I also wore
traditional Korean pants dyed blue, but I did not tie the hems around my ankles. I wore mismatched
rubber shoes; one was large and the other was small. In that wretched state I would go and sit alone on a
rock, where I would weep as I prayed. That place is the Rock of Tears. (168-036, 1987/08/30)

15. When we were refugees, Won-pil painted portraits and sold them. I made the frames and drew the
lines, and he sketched the portraits. After he finished his sketch by drawing the nose, I would set to work
painting it. We used to paint all night long, starting at midnight. We could paint up to 30 portraits a night.
To paint that many, we had to draw lines first. For 30 portraits, once Won-pil brought the paper, it was I
who drew the vertical and horizontal lines. Then, following the lines, he made the sketches.  
We received $4 per painting. What could the American soldiers, who were returning home, bring as gifts
for their wives? Since they knew that the best gift they could bring their wives would be their portrait, we
did this for them. Today we might sell those paintings for $30 or $40, or even $300. On average, Won-pil
painted more than 20 portraits each night. He could not do that by himself, so I assisted him. We would
work together all night long. (096-143, 1978/01/03)

16. I think fondly of the time I lived in Beomnaetgol with Kim Won-pil. To me, those were the best of
times. We usually think of our preschool and elementary school days as the best times. It is because our
mom and dad came to wait for us and bring us home, spending much time with us. That is why we think
those days are the best.  
Likewise, back then, we had such caring hearts for each other. Because we felt each other's hearts so
deeply, it was a good time. I also say it was a good time because, placing God's Will at the center, our
relationships of heart were better than at any other time. That is why I say it was so good back then. (033-
098, 1970/08/09)

17. Around the holy ground at Beomil-dong in Busan, there was nothing but a valley of rocks near a
cemetery. In that place I built my hut, a temporary, humble structure. But when I slept there, I knew I was
walking the best path to practice filial piety as the Son of God, greater filial piety than anyone who enjoys
the splendor of living in any palace of this world. My greatest aspiration was to reach the deepest internal
standard that no one else could reach. In those days, externally I looked like a nobody. I looked like
someone of no value at all. I had a beard on my tanned face, and I was wearing a mixture of Korean and
Western clothing. (022-186, 1969/02/02)

18. You need to know my desperate, sorrowful heart as I held onto the rock at the Holy Ground at
Beomnaetgol. Can you fathom what I prayed about as I looked out over Busan Harbor, which was packed
with cargo ships carrying weapons during the Korean War? All my prayers at the time have been fulfilled.
The Unification Church, which no one in the world welcomed, which everyone cast out, and which went
through all kinds of tribulations, starting from the position of orphan both in name and in reality, now
stands tall.  
Indeed, there is nothing that I have not experienced. Nevertheless, all throughout my life, I have been
doing everything possible to practice filial piety to God. Such is the man, Reverend Moon, whom you are
following, believing in and attending. (145-342, 1986/06/01)

19. World-renowned pastors are now visiting Korea, but why do they come to Korea? They come to visit
the Holy Ground in Busan, where I used to sit in a pitiful state during my time as a refugee. At that time I
sat and thought, "I have to cross the ocean to plant the connection of heart from my country to the lands
across the sea. That is what my heart longs to do. I need to sow those seeds."  
We were still in the midst of the Korean War. In that situation, the world was like an iceberg, so cold and
harsh. Families were separated. Love for parents, spouses or even children could hardly be found. I
prayed, looking out over the sea beyond Busan. God answered me, "Look -- in the future the world will
be like this," and He showed me a vision. I was on a great heavenly ship pulling into port and multitudes
of people were on the pier, shouting with joy and welcoming me. In this way, God comforted me. (148-
271, 1986/10/11)
