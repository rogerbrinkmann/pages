## Chapter 3 Founding the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity

### Section 2 The Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church 

#### The central base
HSA-UWC was founded on May 1, 1954 at a small house in Bukhak-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul.
On January 17, 1955, the church moved to 241-44, Heungin-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, and on
April 27, to a two-story building with a garden at 37, Jangchung-dong 1-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul. On
October 7, 1955, right after True Father was released from Seodaemun Prison, it moved yet
again, this time to 71-3, Cheongpa-dong 1-ga, Yongsan-gu, Seoul. This is the address that the
church used on May 31, 1963, when it registered with the government as Civil Society
Organization No. 261. It is where True Father offered countless prayers while shedding tears and
where he made many conditions of devotion for the advancement of the providence. It is where he
educated members day and night and where he prepared to expand the providence to the
worldwide level. 

1. When we think about all the people in today's world who died for God, just as Elijah said, all I can say
is, "Lord, I alone am left." It is with that heart that I am leading the providence in these miserable
circumstances at the shabby Unification Church building whose address is 71-3, 1-ga, Cheongpa-dong,
Seoul. This is the place under the sun where I am expanding the base for the salvation of the fallen world.
How sad God must feel as he looks down at this place, where a small band of followers and I are striving
to dissolve the 6,000 years of His bitter sorrow. When I think of this, tears well up in my eyes.  
Tears flow down my face when I think of God's situation, so sad and painful. But the question is how
much you have experienced that heart. In the Unification Church, do you relate to God with such a heart?
You have not been thinking this way. (027-075, 1969/11/23)

2. The relationships we have brought for humankind are three-dimensional. They are not based on any
philosophy or ideology that ever existed before. They are relationships originating in God's heart and His
ideal of creation, and from the standard of original nature and character. These relationships are the
essence of all relationships. Therefore, you must guard their absoluteness.  
These relationships have emerged here at Cheongpa-dong. The meaning of Cheongpa-dong is "green
hills," and green hills symbolize the ideal. At Cheongpa-dong, people live singing and aspiring for the
ideal world of peace and freedom, where people sing with hope that is fresh and green. Hence, our
Headquarters Church in Cheongpa-dong is the base where we begin the four-position foundation on the
horizontal plane. (049-206, 1971/10/10)

3. Cheongpa-dong Church was built on the site where a Buddhist temple stood long ago. During the
Japanese occupation, Japanese families lived there. This is such a historic building. After I was released
from Seodaemun Prison in 1955, I had nowhere to go, and I did what I had to do to purchase this
property.  
At first the condition of the house was so terrible that it was like a den of ghosts. Even the poles
supporting the ceiling were tarnished black, and we had to wash them with harsh soda to get them clean.  
So many past relationships were intertwined within the structure. So after I bought this house, I resolved,
"While I am living here, I will ease the pain in all those spirits' bitter, vengeful hearts that have
accumulated over a long history. I will make those who whipped others kneel down, and expel those who
kicked out the innocent people living there." Even now, I have not forgotten my resolution. Even if
everyone leaves me and I am all alone, I will not forget. I will always keep the spirit to subjugate the
entire fallen world. (051-227, 1971/11/28)

4. We must plant God's flag to save Korea. We gathered here to praise His victory in all the places where
that flag is raised high. From the outside, this building may seem like nothing, but even though I live in
this small and humble house, I have a dream of someday leading the whole world.  
Some people ask me why Cheongpa-dong Church Headquarters is so shabby, even as the Unification
Church makes such a sensation worldwide. Indeed it looks shabby, even to me. Its roof was messy with
broken tiles and in need of repair, but I leave it as it is without fixing it. It is not because I do not have the
money, but I would rather save that money and spend it for the salvation of the Korean people.  
When my efforts grow from today's fledgling efforts to reach public awareness, the people of Korea will
understand what the Unification Church has done for them. When the people come to know our history,
how we have fought for this nation on their behalf, they will weep in deep repentance. We sincerely hope
to see that day, and we are ever marching forward to welcome it. The problem is not whether the house in
which I live needs many repairs. I cannot make my residence comfortable as long as this nation and its
people have many wounds that need to be healed. (022-105, 1969/01/26)

5. You need to maintain your dignity as the members of the Headquarters Church. You need to be able to
encourage and raise the spirit of overseas members who yearn to visit the original homeland, who yearn
to meet the people there, who yearn to live there and even stay there forever. If you cannot be God's
representatives, with His heart, and relate to all humanity from that position, you cannot be the people of
the original homeland.  
You need to have the heart to welcome overseas family members who come to see the original homeland.
Whether they are here for a day or two, or even a year, you should be able to live with them joyfully, and
so close that your foreheads touch. Because they want to love you, you should be prepared to share all the
joys and pains of life with them. Otherwise, you will certainly hurt the many members who will come
from abroad to visit Korea and who regard it as their original homeland.  
Cheongpa-dong Church is not just an ordinary place. Countless members from Unification Churches from
every corner of the world will come to Korea, regarding it as their original homeland. In particular, they
will visit Cheongpa-dong Church and hold it in high esteem. Don't be discouraged because its current
condition is not good. People who come to visit here will not expect to worship at a majestic palace.
Rather, they will come longing to embrace this humble Cheongpa-dong Church. (023-087, 1969/05/11) 

#### A historic holy ground 
At the original Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church, the first floor was used as a sanctuary or a
main hall, and the second floor housed True Father's bedroom, the church office, a hall for
commemorative ceremonies, a counseling office and employees' lodgings. At the time, so many
members came to the church. Especially on Sunday, the sanctuary was filled to the bursting point.
True Father would pour out his words, full of grace. The atmosphere of the church services was
always filled with divine spirit. When former church president Eu Hyo-won began giving Divine
Principle lectures every day, the members' spirits were lifted even higher. The sanctuary would
be overflowing with members. Behind the scenes, the elderly women members continually prayed
and offered devotions. Miracles occurred one after another. It was like a blast furnace of heart,
where tears, laughter, reports and testimonies, Divine Principle lectures and the singing of holy
songs never ceased.  
It also was the place for historic events, including True Parents' Holy Wedding, the establishment
of the church's four great holy days, the birth of the True Children, the 36 and 72 Couples
Blessing Ceremonies, and many others. When members throughout Korea offered their devotions
with bows and prayers, they faced in the direction of this main church.  
The Cheongpa-dong Church is a holy altar and a historic holy ground. It is stained with the
countless tears True Parents shed. That is why anyone from anywhere in the world who knows
about the providence yearns for this place and finds their way to it sooner or later. For this
reason, True Father said that it should not be remodeled but preserved in its original form. This
is because, no matter how shabby it may be, it is a place of nostalgia, full of historical memories
and stories.

6. The main Unification Church is here in Cheongpa-dong, Seoul. Do those who work or live here have
any qualification to do so? Even though I do not say anything, I shed tears dozens of times a day. Those
who live close to me know how I live. Even when I hear one word from a member, I can burst into tears. I
am such a sensitive person.  
Even at this moment, I hear family members throughout the nation praying in pain and sorrow. Some are
going hungry; others are suffering from persecution. Still others are in circumstances that allow them no
freedom. You who work or live at Cheongpa-dong need to be the catalysts for conveying my heart to
those family members. Since you work here, whenever it is necessary you must be willing to pay a greater
price. That is why whenever I want to reveal something new, I do not first speak about it at the
Headquarters Church. I share it with the members in the local churches first, and only afterward at the
Headquarters Church. Those who live in the local churches pray more than those at the headquarters. As
people who belong to the Headquarters Church, you should set the highest standard, so that you will not
be ashamed before heaven and earth. (012-327, 1963/08/11)

7. You need to know that there are people who shed tears when they just look at a photo of Cheongpadong Headquarters Church or even when they simply remember it. You have to be able to welcome those
who come here in tears, become their friends, and comfort them from the bottom of your heart. I sincerely
want you to receive many blessings from heaven and become people of whom I can be proud before God.
This is because you live together with me and we have a special bond -- a bond formed from having
shared all kinds of life experiences, both joyful and sorrowful. (012-329, 1963/08/11)

8. I know it is not easy to live with so many people crammed into this small church. We are not the only
ones who are aware of this. God knows it even better than we do. Seeing us like this, people outside our
community may think us foolish, but I do not agree. I have never prayed to God, asking, "Please build me
a church." I even feel honored to be in this situation, with so many people in this small, cramped place.  
When there is an event here, everyone pushes and shoves to come inside. When this happens, rather than
feeling miserable, you should have the heart to comfort God's sorrow, praying, "Aren't we fortunate to be
in this situation?" You need to attend events with this kind of heart.  
When our church has people with this kind of heart, we will be able to pay the indemnity to restore the
world. These miserable circumstances are a true treasure that we Koreans experience, and they are a
resource we can use for restoration through indemnity. These circumstances are not a condition for
unhappiness. They are rather a condition that bestows upon us the benefit and grace of deeply penetrating
God's inner heart and situation, connecting us to the level of His heart and His desire to build us a better
church. (017-273, 1967/02/15)

9. In the future, people from around the world will come to visit Cheongpa-dong Church. This is not just
an empty dream; they will come. Because I lived here, and because from here I pursued the Will of God,
they will come, crossing national borders to follow the vision I have been teaching.  
If I wanted to build a new church building, I could do it even now. But this house was the main church
where many historical events were held. It is the place where heaven and earth wept profusely. It is the
place where many people wept as they experienced God's bitter pain. It is the place where I desperately
appealed to God, even shedding blood. The stains of my tears in this place are connected to unforgettable
memories. It is a sacred altar stained with countless tears of mine and others. It is not the kind of place
you can walk in and out of casually. I have never treated this place in such a casual way. (012-328,
1963/08/11)

10. You should not violate the foundation that I created here with my devotions and prayers. The
Unification Church has been following God's 6,000-year history, always pursuing God's Will. Therefore,
anyone who fails to leave tear-stained footsteps while walking this path cannot become a person of
heaven. That is what I believe.  
I would like to ask you: When you kneel down and pray in tears on this wooden floor, do you feel that
this is the ground of hope that Heavenly Father has eagerly awaited for tens of thousands of years? Do
you experience the feeling of your bone marrow melting and feel in your heart that you are connected to
God in flesh and blood? Are you ever overwhelmed by sorrow and grief that begins with tears but that
tears alone cannot end, so much so that you forget about yourself? Also, when you pray in your daily life,
do you ever completely forget about your personal situation?  
I have laid my foundation with deep prayer and sincere devotion in the most difficult situations, and you
need to do likewise. If you have not, you will be accused by the level of my devotion. It is the same for
me. God has walked the path of suffering for eons while offering devotion for the Will, and I think that I
shall be judged by the standard of His devotion. To be judged based on His devotion will be a most
fearful judgment. Therefore, in every circumstance of my life I struggle desperately with the question of
how I can offer even an hour of devotion such that Heavenly Father feels compelled to comfort me. (042-
233, 1971/03/14)

11. If visitors complain or make negative remarks about the Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church when
they see it, finding it to have a different standard from what they had expected, the heart of longing they
had for the church will vanish. If someone feels, "This is not what I was hoping to see," and utters such
words about it, then even though that person offered much devotion for the main church in the past, that
offering will have been in vain.  
Looking at the shabby Headquarters Church, if that person thinks, "Should this place where I offered
devotions for so long remain the way it is? I will pay any price and make any sacrifice to make this
church better than any other denomination's headquarters church," and if he makes this resolution before
heaven in tears, I believe that he will become my companion in the Will. Because his standard is higher
than anyone else's, God will embrace him in His bosom.  
I have heard many times, directly and indirectly, that most of the overseas family members cannot help
but feel this way. If this is what family members overseas feel and think, the Unification Church members
in Korea should not let themselves fall behind them in caring for the Cheongpa-dong Church. (051-217,
1971/11/28)

12. At the Cheongpa-dong Headquarters Church, we held True Parents' Holy Wedding Ceremony, an
event unprecedented in history. Here too, we conducted many historic works; God's Day, Parents' Day,
Children's Day and the Day of All Things were inaugurated here. The Holy Wedding took place here in
1960\. The 36 Couples and 72 Couples were given the marriage Blessing here as well. This is a historic
place and we must not disgrace it.  
If I wanted to build a new church, I could do it right away. I could take down this building and build a
church structure better than any other church in Korea. However, I am not greedy. I do not hope to get
something unless I first offer devotion and my motivation is God-centered. We cannot establish the true
history and tradition simply by using money for a beautiful new building. (051-228, 1971/11/28)

13. The Unification Church that you see in front of you with your own eyes is not everything. More
important is what is behind it. I visited numerous palaces during my tours of dozens of countries.
However, when I visited them I said to myself, "I will save the world starting from my small place." If I
offer more devotion in this small place than in the extravagant buildings of the world and make a spring
of deep devotion and heart there that God will remember, I believe thirsty people will come to my spring.
It does not matter whether the water of life pours out of a rocky cave or from high on a mountain ridge.
Everyone will go to that spot regardless of where it is. If that place yields true spring water, even a city
will be built there. That place can become the original place of God's history and the birthplace of His
culture. (051-229, 1971/11/28)

14. When I see the pillars holding up the ceiling at the Cheongpa-dong Church, I remember the time when
I shed tears holding onto one of them. I can recall our church history and remember vividly the time when
our whole nation was against us.  
I know some people who keep their loved one's handkerchief inside their bosom as a treasure among all
treasures and find solace from it throughout their lives. For others, that handkerchief may be something
they can throw away in the washroom, but to the former, it is more precious than their own lives. A
handkerchief does not cost much, but once love is involved with it, it becomes priceless. (083-172,
1976/02/08)
