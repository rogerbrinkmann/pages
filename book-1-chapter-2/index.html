<h1 id="chapter-2-the-holy-wedding-of-true-parents-and-the-era-of-true-parents">Chapter 2. The Holy Wedding of True Parents and the Era of True Parents</h1>
<h2 id="section-1-the-marriage-supper-of-the-lamb">Section 1. The Marriage Supper of the Lamb</h2>
<h3 id="the-holy-wedding">The Holy Wedding</h3>
<p><em>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb prophesied in Chapter 19 of the Book of Revelation was
realized through the Holy Wedding of the True Parents. This was the fulfillment of the Book of
Revelation, whereby Adam and Eve, whose fall from grace is recorded in the Book of Genesis,
were recovered.</em></p>
<p><em>The Messiah is the Returning Lord whom God sent to earth in the Last Days of human history as
the Third Adam, along with the spouse God had found for him, who is the Third Eve and the
embodiment of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Wedding of True Parents was the ceremony in which
God blessed them as true husband and wife and as the true ancestors of humankind. Because
human beings were born wrongfully, they need to be reborn; for this, they absolutely need True
Parents.</em></p>
<p><em>On the basis of the Holy Wedding of the True Parents, restoration through indemnity could
proceed beyond the top of the growth stage in the growing period -- the level at which Adam and
Eve fell and became the false parents -- going beyond the point at which Jesus faced the disbelief
of the chosen people of Israel and was made to shoulder the cross.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>The first human ancestors were to start as the good parents, but instead they started as evil parents.
Hence, all human beings were born from the lineage of evil parents. The first human beings were
supposed to directly receive God's complete love as if it were meant for them alone. Having been born as
God's son and daughter, they were to remain so and live in God's bosom as His blood relations, born of
His direct lineage. But this did not happen. This is why humankind must return to the original state.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this, we need the Marriage Supper of the Lamb at which we welcome the Bridegroom and the Bride.
This means that the Lord who is to return must come to earth as the Bridegroom. He must find the Bride
and engraft her onto the standard of Jesus, the standard that Christianity upholds.</p>
<p>Christianity is the religion that firmly pursues its purpose based on the standard of Jesus. This is why the
democratic world is advancing on the basis of Christian values. The democratic world is advancing in this
way in order to receive the True Parents. Religion to this day has been toiling to establish the one true
Son. This means that God has been endeavoring to find the one true Son. (041-028, 1971/02/12)</p>
<ol>
<li>The reason the Bible is the greatest among the scriptures of the many religions is that it introduces God
as the Father, the Parent of humankind. This is the foundation of the Christian faith. Next, it refers to
Jesus as God's only begotten Son. The phrase "God's only begotten Son" means that Jesus is the first
person who could receive the fullness of God's love.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another point is that the Bible introduces the concept of the Bride. Jesus, God's only begotten Son, came
as the Bridegroom. Hence, he needs his Bride. Since there is the Bridegroom, there also must be the
Bride. The Bridegroom and Bride are a man and a woman. On the day of their wedding banquet, God can
finally appear holding the flag of love. God hoped to see such a banquet in the Garden of Eden. This hope
was shattered; hence, in the Last Days this wedding banquet must be held on earth. (135-125, 1985/10/04)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus said, "I am the Son of God," "God is my Father," and "I am the only begotten Son." The only
begotten Son is the Prince of Heaven who can receive God's first love. Among God's sons, he is the only
one who can receive God's first love and receive it in its fullness. Next, there must be the only begotten
Daughter. The Bridegroom is the only begotten Son; the Bride is the only begotten Daughter.</li>
</ol>
<p>They must wed; this is the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. This means that when the Lord comes, he will
have his wedding banquet and then raise a family. This is what God has desired ever since the creation of
Adam and Eve. God's hope is for the only begotten Son and the only begotten Daughter to build a God-
centered family, a family in which He can manifest His love in a real way. (160-272, 1969/05/17)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bible states that in the Last Days, the Messiah will come and conduct the Marriage Supper of the
Lamb, at which time a man and woman join together as husband and wife forging a bond of God's
lineage. Once they emerge as the True Parents of humankind, Satan cannot continue to exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two people, a man and a woman who are bonded to God's lineage, are the embodiments of God the
Father and the Mother, and God's original internal character and original external form.</p>
<p>The True Parents of humankind are motivated by God's love and move by the power of God's life. When
they join together in complete union, God's love, life and lineage will be coursing through them. Each
becomes the owner of the other with their positions constantly changing: the man in the position of the
woman and the woman in the position of the man. At that point, the seeds of life, namely, their
descendants, will be connected to God.</p>
<p>This is the ideal of creation. But due to the Fall, this ideal was shattered. In order to recover the lost ideal
of creation, True Parents need to recover all that was lost. In doing so, True Parents represent all creation,
represent humankind, and represent our Heavenly Parent. This is the essence of the providence of
salvation. (325-131, 2000/06/30)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bible states that at the coming of the Lord, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb will take place. In
order to have this wedding banquet, Jesus needs his Bride. That Bride is Eve who was with Adam before
the Fall. Jesus is the Second Adam, and the Lord at the Second Advent is the Third Adam. The Third
Adam needs to come as Adam before the Fall and find Eve before the Fall. And then he must hold the
Marriage Supper of the Lamb. By their marriage, the two of them will become the True Parents of
humankind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adam and Eve should have become the good parents of humankind, but they fell and became the evil
parents of humankind. In order for us to be restored, we need to meet the good parents whom Adam and
Eve would have become had they not fallen. Humankind absolutely needs the good parents. The purpose
of the Marriage Supper of the Lamb is for the good parents to ascend to their throne. (036-264,
1970/12/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>The original human beings were not supposed to fall. They were supposed to receive God's blessing at
the right time, and within the right environment, to become the true ancestors of humankind. But they
failed to do so; instead, they became the fallen ancestors. Thus, the good ancestor, free from the Fall,
should appear in front of all humankind. He is the one who can become the True Father to all in the
spiritual world and the physical world. Christianity calls this person the Lord at the Second Advent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb is the banquet to which the returning Jesus comes as the True Father to
bring forth a woman as the True Mother. This is the core truth of Christianity. The center of Christianity
is Jesus, and the center of Jesus is love. The center of the Bible is also love. The center of love is the
Bride and Bridegroom, and the center of the Bride and Bridegroom is the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
The paramount significance of the Marriage Supper of the Lamb is that the Returning Lord and his Bride
receive the Marriage Blessing at the time of God's choosing and in the right environment, whereby they
become the true ancestors of humankind who can inherit heaven and earth. (009-254, 1960/06/05)</p>
<ol>
<li>God has been looking for the persons who can represent Adam and Eve whom God had lost. The Bible
calls Jesus the Second Adam. It calls Adam the tree of life. Thus, Jesus is the one who came in place of
the tree of life that had been lost. However, he could not complete his original mission because he was not
able to welcome the day of his wedding, when both God and the Son could rejoice. That is why he left
earth with the promise that he will return.</li>
</ol>
<p>The day will arrive when God and Jesus rejoice together. The day will come when they can openly
express their heart filled with 6,000 years of bitter pain and sorrow. The day will come when the coming
Lord can establish the bond of lineage linking God to His sons and daughters.</p>
<p>Suppose that when Jesus came to earth as God's only begotten Son, he had not died on the cross. Since he
was God's only begotten Son, God surely would have sent His only begotten Daughter to him. God has
searched for 2,000 years to find the Bride. Jesus emerged as the true Son, but there is no mention of the
true Daughter anywhere in the Bible. That is why God's Will was not realized.</p>
<p>The purpose of the 2,000-year history of Christianity has therefore been to find God's Daughter. The Holy
Spirit came, but it represents this daughter of God only in spirit. God's bitter sorrow over this matter will
be dissolved on the day that the Marriage Supper of the Lamb takes place. (007-303, 1959/10/11)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Religion up to now has been seeking for the one ideal man and the one ideal woman. Through religion,
God has been looking for the one man and the one woman of whom He could say, "You are my total
love." The Bridegroom and the Bride in Christianity refer to God's Will to seek throughout the world for
the only begotten Son and the only begotten Daughter who can receive God's love in its fullness. When
He finds that perfected man and perfected woman, God brings them together and holds a wedding
banquet; from that point a new world can unfold. That is why on his return the Lord must find the Bride
and hold the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. (041-027, 1971/02/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the first human beings had not fallen, they would have borne sons and daughters without original sin
and established a family that could directly enter the kingdom of heaven in heaven. They would have
stood as the True Parents. Their family would have been one with God. Their sons and daughters would
have been the offspring of God's family. However, the first family in Genesis did not fulfill the Will to
establish that family; that is why, in the Book of Revelation, St. John raised the issue of establishing the
Bride and the Bridegroom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bridegroom is the one who comes as the perfected True Father, and the Bride is the one who appears
as the True Mother, the beloved of God. If Adam and Eve had not fallen, they would have married
centered on God, but due to the Fall, they married centered on Satan. True Parents must reclaim Adam
and Eve on behalf of God, and then conduct the Holy Wedding centered on God. This is the Marriage
Supper of the Lamb that is spoken of in the Book of Revelation. (053-037, 1972/02/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>On the day when two human beings, a filial son of God and a filial daughter of God, can stand before
God as the Bridegroom and Bride for the first time since the creation of heaven and earth, God will say to
them, "You have worked so hard to come here seeking heaven's heart and the heart of the Heavenly
Parent, even amid all the adversity on earth!" He then will give His blessing to this couple and install
them as the True Parents who represent the incorporeal God in physical form. Such is the cosmic banquet,
the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb is offered based on the Bridegroom and Bride having become a true
filial son and daughter, with the true Bride having pledged herself to the Will and having understood the
Will. From the day they receive the Blessing, they become the True Parents of humankind who represent
the incorporeal God in substantial form.</p>
<p>If the first human beings had not fallen, they would have grown up in a good world and received the
Blessing in the love of God. Adam and Eve would have become children who could intimately know
God's heart. In their loving union, they would have made a bond of heart with God that would have
enabled God to say to them, "You are My filial son and daughter, and you can represent My heart." The
new Adam and Eve cannot become God's filial son and daughter unless they feel connected to Him in
heart. Thus, they need to understand God's inner heart and the course through which He suffered. By
doing so, they can meet the conditions required of Adam and Eve for realizing the ideal of creation. The
Marriage Supper of the Lamb is precisely the event through which those conditions are met. (009-107,
1960/04/24)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The day of the Marriage Supper of the Lamb is the day when we celebrate the wedding banquet of the
True Parents, who finally were found after being lost for 6,000 years. Originally, it would have been
impossible for unfallen human beings in the position of children to watch their parents, the True Parents,
having their wedding banquet. However, since the True Parents arrived after the fact, the order was
reversed. Originally, Adam and Eve would have celebrated their wedding banquet while attending God
the True Parent, and then they would have given birth to true children and built an ideal world. However,
due to the Fall, fallen human beings multiplied first before the emergence of the True Parents. Therefore,
your desire should be to meet the True Parents. You need to recover that which went in the wrong
direction; this is restoration through indemnity. Hence, those fallen human beings who were born earlier
than the True Parents must go in the opposite direction. You must go in the direction opposite to what the
secular world wants. (019-203, 1968/01/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Jesus to fulfill his purpose in his lifetime, he needed to find his Bride. But he was not able to do
so. That is why he left the concept "I am the Bridegroom, and you are the Bride" as his last testament. The
resurrected Jesus looked for the Bride throughout the world. He searched for the best candidate among the
most faithful believers within the realm of the Second Israel, regardless of nationality. For the past 2,000
years, he made continual efforts in search of her. When he finds the Bride, the true human ancestors can
emerge; when the true human ancestors emerge, the True Parents can emerge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Originally, in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve should have become the true human ancestors and
should have been installed as the True Parents. However, due to the Human Fall, it is only now in the era
of the Second Coming, after 6,000 years have passed, that God could find the true ancestors of
humankind. Finally, a man emerged who prevailed over Satan's world and received the Holy Wedding
from God. Now he has re-created Eve. By attaining that position, he has restored the standard for
inaugurating the ancestors of humankind for the first time, 6,000 years after Adam and Eve. Only after
numerous fallen children had multiplied did True Parents reverse the order and come forth. (019-163,
1968/01/01)</p>
<h3 id="the-turning-point-in-providential-history">The turning point in providential history</h3>
<p><em>True Parents' Holy Wedding, held on April 11, 1960, was the historic moment when the history of
restoration through indemnity climbed over the mountain of indemnity at the completion level of
the growth stage. The Holy Wedding of True Parents was a global and cosmic event. True
Father, who came as the perfected Adam on the foundation of the long history of the providence,
laid the foundation on earth to receive True Mother, the original Eve. True Father represents
heaven, True Mother represents earth, and their union finally connected the spiritual world and
the physical world, which had been divided. Finally, the standard required to break down the
wall that had separated Adam and Eve from God had been met.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Some historians say that in the 1960s history entered a time of great transition. The perspective of the
Unification Principle is that although Korea became the base for the Christian cultural sphere to receive
the Messiah, the Christian cultural sphere failed when it did not accept me. Nevertheless, we can assert
that once the Holy Wedding had been held in the name of God and True Parents, history finally began
turning in a new direction.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the present circumstances, history is full of changes. It appears that humankind is declining and
descending into a world of death, and that the world, beset by many divisions, is heading for destruction.
But at the same time, we can realize that the scope of historical events is moving beyond national and
regional levels and expanding to the world.</p>
<p>Ever since we entered the providential era during which we had to expand our foundation horizontally
based on the bond of the God-centered lineage that we have with True Parents, the world has been beset
by ideological confusion. Traditions have been falling into chaos. Things are being shaken up.
Christianity also is being totally shaken up.</p>
<p>The Holy Wedding was held 14 years after Korea's liberation from Japan. During that time, the Christian
churches in Korea were either those that were rebuilding after years underground or those that had
survived because their members had followed the dictates of the Japanese and offered bows at Shinto
shrines. The way began to open up by which God could lead the providence with Korea as its base and
make a leap to expand to the world.</p>
<p>The starting point for this transition was True Parents' Holy Wedding that took place in April 1960. After
the Holy Wedding Ceremony, Parents' Day was inaugurated. That was the day when we finally could
clear up humankind's history, a history imprisoned by bonds of defiled love, life and lineage from the
false parents. The original love, life and lineage centered on God were newly planted and began to deepen
their roots on earth. Although the world that had received the fallen archangel's lineage had continued up
to that point, from that day in 1960, when the True Parents emerged, the lineage of the original Adam and
Eve began to take root centering on God's love. (196-218, 1990/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The peak, or apex, of the providence of restoration occurred in 1960. At that time, I was receiving
persecution from the nation and the people of Korea, from all the Christian denominations and even from
some church members. I was in a desperate, life-and-death situation. Indeed, the Unification Church was
at a moment of truth; its very survival was at stake. In those difficult circumstances, I nevertheless
proceeded with the Holy Wedding. At that point, a new history began. The Holy Wedding was a historic
turning point. Even historians state that 1960 was a turning point. From that point on I began resolving all
the problems one by one. (052-068, 1971/12/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>April 11, 1960, was the day of True Parents' Holy Wedding. Externally speaking it was an ordinary
day; nothing seemed out of the ordinary. However, the Holy Wedding that took place on that day made it
a day totally different from any other in history. Because of that day, human history is now in the hands of
one person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment of that one person's coming, were the circumstances prepared such that he could build a
relationship with a nation and with the world? Did the circumstances of that moment have a strong
enough foundation to pass on to him its relationships with history, with the present age, and with the
future? The ceremony itself may appear to have been a simple event, but once people realize that it was
the core event representing the entirety of human history, people throughout history will study the
significance of that one day. (032-069, 1970/06/21)</p>
<ol>
<li>Adam, the ancestor of humankind, lost the authority of dominion because, at the completion level of
the growth stage, he listened to Eve and followed her desire. To restore this through indemnity, Jesus had
to come to earth as a human being who, one with God's love and having a perfect character, could fulfill
the purpose of creation. Then he had to find the one woman who could follow him to fulfill the Will. God
created Eve from Adam; thus the re-creation of Adam and Eve must be done in the same order. Adam
must be re-created first; then he must establish Eve as his Bride and start a new family in order to walk
toward a perfect world.</li>
</ol>
<p>The re-creation of Adam and Eve marks the end of the fallen era in history and the beginning of a new
era. This is what happened in 1960. The establishment of that bond of love centering on True Parents was
truly a cosmic event. (028-013, 1970/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>God's purpose of creation and His work of re-creation can be realized now that Adam and Eve have
received the Marriage Blessing at their Holy Wedding. God had worked to realize this ever since the first
human ancestors fell at the completion level of the growth stage, and from the viewpoint of that course of
restoration, all humankind today must climb to that level.</li>
</ol>
<p>The formation stage of the growing period corresponds to the age of the servant; the growth stage
corresponds to the age of adopted children; and the completion stage corresponds to the age of direct
children. After history had passed through the Old Testament Age, the age of the servant, Jesus' gospel
appeared on earth. At that point, human history entered the realm of adopted children. The human
ancestors, still in the realm of adopted children, fell at the completion level of the growth stage.
Therefore, fallen human beings must connect to the external foundation of the Son and be re-created.
Then they can be elevated to the completion level of the growth stage in order to finally inherit the realm
of direct children.</p>
<p>In short, since the completion level of the growth stage is the level from which the human ancestors fell,
we have to reach that level in order to be restored. However, since the Fall took place in the process of
forming their family, we cannot reach the standard that God desires unless we establish a family. That is
why True Parents conducted the Holy Wedding in 1960 in the Unification Church; it was in order to reach
that standard. (028-012, 1970/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>I fought with the spirit world and was victorious on the individual level. To win that victory I faced
winds that threatened to sweep me away; they were harsher than the harshest winds on earth. Tens of
millions of times I had to resolve to persevere against the powers of death. Whenever I came face-to-face
with the enemy, Satan, I told myself, "I cannot collapse. I cannot die. If I die, who will establish the will
of heaven? No matter how much I suffer, I have to live. Even if my four limbs are amputated and I am
bed-ridden the rest of my life, I absolutely must not die." With this resolve, I was able to overcome all
obstacles on that incredibly difficult path.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am the type of person who fears having my name known to the world before I establish a strong
foundation. I fear becoming famous before an adequate foundation is laid. In such a case, it is a principle
that Satan is bound to attack. Therefore, as I needed to pass my 40-year milestone without dying, I looked
forward to that day while silently hoping that the time would pass by quickly. I knew I had to establish
the condition of the number 40, since Abraham had established the number 40 and Jesus had come at the
end of 4,000 years of history. Thus, I looked forward to passing that 40-year milestone. Hoping for many
long years to reach that day, I struggled fiercely to fulfill all my responsibilities without dying so that I
might stand victorious before heaven and earth. (013-039, 1963/10/16)</p>
<ol>
<li>God sent Jesus after 4,000 years. He came after a long history had passed. Jesus was born after only
ten months (by Korean counting) in his mother's womb, but for him to come to earth had taken 4,000
years of preparation. Because he came with such a historical foundation, Jesus was in a position to
indemnify the entire history of 4,000 years. Originally, he was supposed to complete the condition to
indemnify that history by the age of 40, but due to the disbelief of his people, he was unable to
accomplish that.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we had to indemnify that period of history during the seven-year course leading up to the Holy
Wedding in 1960. I am sure that you all know about 40-day restoration periods. Since Jesus was unable to
reach the age of 40, the course to overcome the obstacle of the number 40 remained with us. Since that
indemnity course still had to be fulfilled, as the Returning Lord I had no choice but to persevere through
seven years of great tribulations. The basis of this exists within the Principle of Restoration. (019-150,
1968/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>How could I surpass the hurdle of the number 40 in 1960? How could I get past the number 40 that
is based on the teaching of the Principle? Jesus died at the age of 33; he was 7 years short of achieving the
number 40. That is why during the remaining seven-year period I had to face great tribulations in the
human world. I was confronted with the issue of how I could overcome these obstacles. In order to
overcome them, I had to go against the flow and follow the course of restoration that Jacob passed
through, and all the entangled indemnity courses of the numerous forebears in the course of providential
history.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had no friends or colleagues on this path. Even those who said they would follow me ended up being
burdens to me on the path that I had to take; they strewed it with thorns and created obstacles for me.
There was no one to help me. (019-111, 1967/12/31)</p>
<ol>
<li>The path of my life up to age 40 was the time for me to achieve victory on the individual level before
I finally could move on and create a horizontal foundation. The purpose of that period in my life was to
indemnify the history of restoration in order to establish the one Adam. Then in 1960, the time came to
create the horizontal foundation on which to bring victory centering on Adam.</li>
</ol>
<p>The victory I am talking about is the victory on the national level that Jesus was not able to reach.
Therefore, based on my having reached the age of 40, the Unification Church in the 1960s had to
substantially indemnify and overcome the destiny Jesus faced when he was unable to surmount the
obstacles to reaching the age of 40. That is why the Unification Church in the 1960s received enormous
persecution. If I, as the representative of humankind, had not had the courage to make a decisive oath in
front of God that I would divide good from evil, the work of the providence would have been delayed.
(075-010, 1975/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>True Parents' Holy Wedding was a cosmic, momentous event, worthy of a great celebration on earth.
Thereby the True Parents, as God's embodiments, gained the world-level victory both spiritually and
physically. This was the vertical indemnity condition for resolving issues on the horizontal plane on earth.
In order to be in the position to conduct the Holy Wedding, I had to restore Jesus' three main disciples
who failed to support him. I had to indemnify the failure of Adam to properly establish a family.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the Fall, Adam and Eve, the first human ancestors, were unable to form a true conjugal
relationship. The Fall occurred through the act of two individuals, a man and a woman. Therefore,
restoration cannot be completed by one person alone. A man cannot be restored alone, nor can a woman
go to heaven alone. Nothing can be resolved without the efforts of two individuals. After restoring the
positions of unfallen Adam and Eve, these two individuals are to establish the standard of the True
Parents on earth. This requires the betrothal of three disciples. (022-190, 1969/02/02)</p>
<ol>
<li>The goal of the providence of restoration is to restore Adam's family. Due to the failure of Adam's
family, the providence moved to Noah's family. God destroyed all people on Earth through the flood
judgment, except for Noah's family; then, based on that family He intended to establish a providential
foundation that was beyond Satan's accusation. Then the providence moved to Abraham, Jacob, Moses
and Jesus, and now it has arrived at this era. We must indemnify all of it, and the center is Adam's family.</li>
</ol>
<p>The position of the True Parents cannot be established without the restoration of the three children whom
Adam had lost. That is why Jesus absolutely needed his three disciples. They also represented the three
archangels. The three archangels were not united in obedience and attendance to Adam and Eve. As a
result, the world became fallen. That is why Jesus had to restore three disciples in order to stand in the
position of the True Parent. Likewise, the Lord at the Second Advent also must have three spiritual
children who absolutely obey him. Otherwise, he cannot stand in the position of the True Parent. This is
the formula. I had to have three disciples who would absolutely follow me as filial sons, even in life-and-
death situations in the midst of persecution.</p>
<p>In April of 1960, I was able to establish these three disciples. Since the course of restoration goes in
reverse, the betrothal ceremony was given first to those who stood in the children's position. Jacob's
family is representative of the family realm, so the foundation for the betrothal had to be made based on
the number 12. That standard should be established based on those three disciples. (022-190, 1969/02/02)</p>
<ol>
<li>After the Holy Wedding in 1960, I created holy salt. Do you know why? It was because True Parents
should not use anything from the fallen world. God's Son is the Parent whom God has perfected.
Everything that is defiled in the fallen world should be burned; however, since this is not possible in
practice, holy salt was created as an alternative. Sprinkling things with holy salt symbolizes cleansing the
things of the fallen world. Applying holy salt cleanses Satan's world and, on that condition, heaven's side
is able to use the things in the fallen world. Once God's nation is established, no one will be able to use
the things of the world and its nations as they are, even their most valued antiques, without cleansing
them. (267-119, 1995/01/03)</li>

<p><em>Jesus came to earth to bring an end to the history that had resulted from the Fall of Adam and
Eve, and to restore the world of God's ideal of creation. But due to the disbelief of the chosen
people of Israel and the Jews of that time, he was unable to fulfill the Will. He ascended to
heaven, leaving behind the promise that he would come again. Following in Jesus' footsteps, True
Father took up the mission of the Messiah. He began his public ministry on August 15, 1945, the
day Korea regained its independence.</em></p>
<p><em>True Father tried to make unity with Christianity in the early days of his course. However, when
that course was frustrated due to Christians' disbelief, he had to lay the foundation for a new
providential church representing Christianity. For this, he endured great tribulations as he
walked the course of indemnity to restore the conditions for the Three Blessings. On May 1, 1954
in Seoul, he founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-
UWC). After that, he walked a seven-year course to restore through indemnity the entire New
Testament Age.</em></p>
<p><em>Since True Father had surmounted a total of 40 years of indemnity, counting from the time of his
birth, he succeeded in separating Satan from his course. Then, on April 11, 1960, he and True
Mother held their glorious Holy Wedding Ceremony. Thereby they became the first human
ancestors, husband and wife, in front of God.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jesus died on the cross 2,000 years ago, unable to fully accomplish his mission. Today, 2,000 years
later, True Parents must fulfill what Jesus wanted to fulfill. Jesus wanted to fulfill it in his time based on
the Jewish people, but he could not. Now at this second attempt, we must substantiate the union of True
Father and True Mother centered on the worldwide foundation of Christianity. Without establishing this
foundational point, you cannot become true sons and true daughters of God's direct lineage. The ideal of
the Second Advent is to set the standard for humankind to be connected to God's lineage. The goal of the
Second Advent is also to have a true family, for it is with such a family that heaven's way can begin. With
it, true love and happiness can commence. (019-104, 1967/12/31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When something is broken, bringing it back to its original condition requires that it be repaired. The
world wants to be made new. The nation, the society, the individual -- all want to be made new. People
want to be made new as God's sons and daughters. Jesus came as the new Son, so there had to be a new
Daughter. However, Jesus was killed before he could find this new Daughter. That one Mother was the
hope of the whole universe. Jesus' path to find her was full of hardship and persecution. His situation was
miserable. He was persecuted and chased from field to field and from town to town. Jesus tried to
accomplish God's Will by finding her through Joseph's family -- his own family from David's tribe, but he
could not. So he left his home and followed a course of public life for three years, still searching for her.
(019-161, 1968/01/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that at present you cannot see God's face makes it seem as if you are still living in the womb.
Your situation is that you have yet to be born. This means you must be born again. Because the
providence of spiritual salvation already has been accomplished, people can be reborn spiritually.
However, this will not suffice. You need to be reborn in both spirit and flesh.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the future, the Lord will return, but he will come as the True Parent. He will come to earth in the flesh
as the Father of humanity. He will come in the flesh as the Bridegroom, and from among the people, he
will find his Bride and establish her as the True Mother of humankind in the flesh. Then, finally, the
unfallen True Parents will emerge. Because Adam and Eve fell, the True Parents were lost. Hence, people
today are descended from the fallen parents, not the unfallen True Parents.</p>
<p>The Lord has returned in the flesh, in accordance with the providence of restoration, in order to complete
the mission of the True Parent. He comes with the truth about the history of the Human Fall. With this
truth, he must fully resolve this problem: when people have only the foundation of Jesus' spiritual
salvation, Jesus cannot give them birth as sons and daughters who can achieve perfection in both spirit
and flesh. (012-228, 1963/05/15)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus came to earth as the Second Adam. The Holy Spirit, as the Second Eve, was unable to assume a
body. If you were to go to the spirit world, you would see that the Holy Spirit is the Mother Spirit of God.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Jesus returns to earth in the flesh, the woman whom he takes as the Bride must meet the
qualifications, as stipulated by the Principle, to be the Bride. This requires that she knows all aspects of
the heavenly way. It requires that she looks forward to the Returning Lord's coming and prepares to
welcome him. These are the conditions she needs in order to prepare herself to establish the one God-
centered family, nation and world. This is her responsibility as the Bride. That is also why, as we entered
the 1960s, the women's movement began and is developing throughout the world.</p>
<p>No matter how many people there are on earth, they are all descendants of the Fall. They were all born
from the evil, fallen lineage. Therefore, a true woman must emerge who can love them as their True
Mother. As the Last Days draw near, the time is approaching when such a woman will appear. This is
why, to prepare the environment, women's movements are springing up worldwide.</p>
<p>We have now arrived at a time when many women can surpass men. The Last Days is the time when
women can restore the Fall, and these women in the realm of grace are able to come forward and
represent the heavenly Eve. Today it is not just a matter of women's liberation; women can stand in such a
position. Therefore, the True Mother must appear during this time. We must be able to attend this Mother
on earth. Humankind has been trying to return to God, and as we enter the era when this can happen, the
Bride must be established on earth. (016-182, 1966/03/22)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Unification Church is the first parent-type religion. Religion began with the servant religion and
has progressed to the adopted-child religion, the stepchild religion, the son and daughter religion, and then
the mother religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>God has been ever looking for the mother. God, the masculine subject partner, has had no partner. He
needs a female object partner. She is His partner, and at the same time she is the queen of earth. She is the
queen of the tribes and queen of the families. She stands as the grandmother of all ancestors, the mother
of all humankind, the wife of God and the daughter of God.</p>
<p>Mother is such a woman, with the value of the original True Mother. She is the queen of heaven, the
queen of earth, the queen of the nation, the grandmother to her ancestors, the mother of humankind, the
wife of God and the daughter of God. Mother's value is found in all of these roles. (398-134, 2002/12/09)</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever heard people say that they believe in salvation through the family? If you ask Christians
who they believe in, they will answer, "I believe in Jesus." Buddhists, too, would say that they believe in
the Buddha, rather than in his family. However, in the future a religion to save the family needs to appear.
This is True Parents' teaching, which is the true parent religion. The true parent religion will enable you to
establish your own four-position foundation and live your life as true parents. Then you as the father and
mother become the saviors of your sons and daughters.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Book of Revelation includes content concerning the work of restoration. This is one reason the Bible
is great. Because of the principle of restoration, the core content of restoration was placed at the end of
the Bible. Revelation 22:17 reads, "The Holy Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come.' And let everyone who
hears say, ‘Come.' And let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as
a gift." Do you know whom the Bride and the Holy Spirit refer to? The Bride refers to the Lord's wife.
The Holy Spirit is only a spiritual being. Therefore, the Mother with both spirit and flesh needs to appear.
Jesus, the Father of humankind, is a man, so the Mother of humankind must be found among women.
When she is found, together they will save all humankind by guiding them to a new world. (021-050,
1968/09/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mother, this woman whom I have married, is truly great. Her greatness does not come from a beautiful
face but from a beautiful heart. Even her beautiful voice and her graceful manner are because of her
beautiful heart. I am a teacher who teaches God's philosophy by actually living it. Because I am living
according to the Principle, I praise Mother and promote her in front of the public on God's behalf. This is
in accordance with the Principle. (229-224, 1992/04/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People throughout the world say that my wife is beautiful. I spent some time thinking about what
makes a person truly beautiful. A beautiful woman is not someone who has a beautiful face. To be a truly
beautiful woman, she must be beautiful in heart. The beauty of such a woman will not diminish even after
1,00 0 years. Even after all that time, she will possess a refined and harmonious appearance. Such a
woman can embrace her surroundings and bring out the best in any situation. Such a woman is the beauty
of all beauties. Mother has that kind of beauty. That is why I think she is the beauty among beauties.
(220-175, 1991/10/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mother is a woman of great wisdom. Also, her eyes are magnificent. When she smiles, I am completely
mesmerized by her charming eyes. She has such beautiful eyes. I really like Mother's nose too. When she
senses something good is coming, she laughs in such a way that her nostrils start to flutter. I am not sure
if this is Mother's charm, but I tell you that, as her husband, it moves my heart. Also, if we encounter a
grave or serious situation, Mother tries not to purse her lips to show that she is upset. When I see her
wisely restraining herself like that, I find her lips even more beautiful. Mother also has a lovely demeanor.
Indeed, she has many great qualities. I think wives who possess these graces carry the secret keys to solve
all problems and make all things go well. (127-093, 1983/05/05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of Mother's special qualities is that she is intuitive. This is an inborn quality. Further, whenever I
ask her to do something, she makes a firm resolution to fulfill it. Then she never forgets that resolution
until it is done. That is why she has been able to overcome every trial on her path. She has perseverance
and patience for God's purpose. Another reason I am very grateful to Mother is that she is very giving.
She always wants to give away her most precious possessions, not only to our own children, but also to
all of you, at any time and without hesitation. I believe that this trait of her personality is a God-given gift.
(092-329, 1977/05/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mother needed to give birth to at least 12 children within a span of 20 years in order to completely
restore Jacob's family through paying indemnity. Jesus' 12 disciples could not unite with each other.
What did they do? They abandoned Jesus, and one of them ended up selling him. Why did this happen?
One problem was that despite their brotherly ties, the disciples were from different tribes. There was a
problem in Jacob's family because he had sons and daughters born from four different women. In my
time, in order to overcome that problem Mother gave birth to at least 12 children within a 20-year time
period. Had she not succeeded in this, she could not have fulfilled her mission as True Mother.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From this point of view, you can see that no one more than 20 years old could have fulfilled the position
of True Mother. She had to be at most 18 or 19 years old. That is why at the age of 40 I married Mother
who was just 17 years old. Just as I embarked on the path for the Will at the age of 16, a woman had to
meet that standard at around the same age. Otherwise, she would have no way to bring about the
liberation of women. (247-255, 1993/05/09)</p>
<ol>
<li>Throughout history there was no woman who was willing to suffer through all kinds of miserable
situations and still support her husband through even more difficulties, continually and without complaint.
If there were a woman who suffered through such hardships and then said, "Standing before the Will, I
have nothing but gratitude," that woman would be able to comfort us when we felt discouraged.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such is the case with True Mother. At the point at which she started her life with me, she had to pay
incredible indemnity in heart. She had to avoid having any condition to be accused, whether from above
or from below. It didn't matter that she was younger than 20 years old; if God permitted His object partner
to be someone of that age, that young woman had to be able to adapt to whatever difficult situation she
might face.</p>
<p>That is why it was good that I found Mother among those who came from a solitary family background.
Mother came from a simple family. She had no father or older brother. She had only one person with her:
her mother, Grandmother Hong, a woman who was willing to do anything for heaven. (121-212,
1982/10/27)</p>
<ol>
<li>Mother was 17 years old at the time of the Holy Wedding. I was 40 years old. As a fully grown man,
I received a young lady of 17 years as my wife and placed her in the position of True Mother. This was
unacceptable in the eyes of the world, but I had to do it for the sake of the providence. There was no other
way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ever since I received her as Mother, I have been leading the providence with her. So when we were
engaged, I explained everything about the path I had to follow, saying, "This is the way I must go."
Mother respects me because whatever I do is in accordance with the providential program. I also gave her
basic guidelines, saying, "If you are attacked in this way, you need to overcome it like this. If you are
attacked in that way, you must do things that way." Mother respects me because I do what I say I will do.
Even though the path is difficult, I overcome each obstacle and move forward. (236-109, 1992/11/03)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A month before the Holy Wedding, Father appeared to me in a dream and gave me a special
revelation from God, "Be prepared, for that day is at hand." More than a marriage proposal, it was a
decree from heaven. When I received that decree, I was completely overwhelmed. Because at the time I
did not have the ability to deal with such a monumental matter, I had to empty myself. All I could do was
pray. I responded while constantly keeping that revelation in mind, thinking, "O God, I have been living
in accordance with Your Will. I will follow and do whatever Your Will may be. Whatever Your
providential purpose for me may be, I will follow as You command." I was 17 years old, and it was
sometime in February. I did not want to analyze the situation at that time because I was making internal
preparations by emptying myself. I only wanted to follow God's Will. (True Mother, 1977/05/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know of a story from the line of my mother's family that seems like a legend. In the Jo clan of my
maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo, there is a record about a Maitreya statue from the time of our ancestor
Jo Han-Jun. In 1991, when I went with Father to North Korea, I inquired whether this statue of the
Maitreya actually existed. I was told that it still exists to this day. According to this story, Jo Han-jun had
a dream in which the Maitreya Buddha promised him that a princess from heaven would be sent to his
descendants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was born into that loyal family in remembrance of this ancestor's devotion to the nation. My
grandmother was born into that lineage, and my mother, Daemonim, was born from her. Thus, heaven
began to work from the time of Jo Han-jun in order to prepare the environment in which I would meet the
Messiah at his Second Coming and be raised up as his partner.</p>
<p>From this, we can learn a lesson: Heaven will absolutely remember whatever conditions we make. This is
why when I met Father I already understood what would be essential to my mission. Since I was born and
grew up in the environment that God had prepared, I knew what I had to do and the mission I needed to
accomplish.</p>
<h3 id="the-holy-wedding-of-the-true-parents">The Holy Wedding of the True Parents</h3>
<p><em>After True Father traveled the path of blood, sweat and tears to indemnify Jesus' course, he was
engaged to True Mother. She was the only daughter of Mrs. Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim), who was
devoting her entire life with complete dedication to serve and attend the Lord at his Second
Advent. The engagement took place at the original Cheongpa-dong headquarters church in Seoul,
at 4:00 in the morning on March 27, 1960 (1st day of the 3rd lunar month). Four days later, on
March 31, Father officially decided to hold the Holy Wedding of the True Parents and the
Blessing of three of their main disciples.</em></p>
<p><em>On April 11, 1960 (16th day of the 3rd lunar month), at 10: 00 a.m. at the former headquarters
church in Seoul, the historic Holy Wedding of the True Parents was held. More than 7 00
members were in attendance, invited from every church in Korea. There were two ceremonies:
The first was the Ceremony to Restore the Parents through Indemnity, and the second, held
immediately following the first, was the Ceremony for the Parents of Glory. (True Mother,
2012/12/25)</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Mother and I were blessed in marriage in 1960, 14 years after the liberation of Korea. Why did it take
14 years? The ancestors of humankind fell at the completion level of the growth stage. Thus, based on the
principle of restoration through indemnity, it took a period of 14 years filled with persecution for me to
take root in Korea and build an altar named the Unification Church. All of this was to place True Mother
in her position. I had to do it even as we fought against the opposition of Christianity and the Republic of
Korea.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the establishment of True Mother, God could finally settle on earth. To achieve this, I set conditions
to indemnify and resolve the problems in providential history that occurred in the times of Adam, Noah,
Abraham and thereafter. Although the Christian cultural sphere took over and dealt with all these issues,
including establishing a nation and a people representing Israel that was prepared to receive me, when
Christianity turned against me, it was as if the spiritual foundation that it had restored through paying
indemnity for 2,000 years crumbled.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I found Mother 14 years after God called me, I was providentially in the same situation
as when Jesus died on the cross. In other words, the Republic of Korea stood in the same position as
Israel at the time of Jesus. Likewise, Christianity was in the same position as Judaism, and I and the
Unification Church were in the same position as Jesus and the early Christian church. Since Jesus carried
the cross on account of persecution by the nation of Israel and Judaism, we had to battle through the same
situation and win. We had to restore everything through paying indemnity. (143-178, 1986/03/18)</p>
<ol>
<li>I had to fight up to the last minute. The day before going to the wedding venue, I had to go to the
police station and write an affidavit. Numerous betrayers made accusations against me. Just as Jesus' 12
disciples betrayed him, 12 previously faithful church members banded together against me. Individuals
who had been on the side of the Unification Church began to oppose me, other churches opposed me, and
the nation opposed me. Just as the nation of Israel, the leaders of Judaism, and Judas Iscariot banded
together and killed Jesus, I was being driven toward a similar fate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The date of the Holy Wedding was the 16th day of the 3rd lunar month in 1960. That time marked the
highest peak of opposition. I stood on the dividing line between moving one step forward or one step
back, between life and death, between making a new start and not making one. In those circumstances, I
managed to bring a new historic result.</p>
<p>On that day, God made the greatest proclamation in human history, the proclamation that will spread
heavenly fortune to the world. It was the historic day that Jesus spoke about -- the day of welcoming the
Bride. It was the day of True Parents' Holy Wedding. From that moment on, I could go on the offensive
and take the first steps forward. Finally, I could begin resolving the problems we faced and move swiftly
forward centered on God. (067-250, 1973/07/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the path of restoration through paying indemnity, we must follow a law or formula -- that of
making certain required conditions. Around the time the Holy Wedding was going to take place, some
Unification Church members left the church. Twelve persons who had once been members of the church
banded together and started opposing me, just as Jesus' 12 disciples opposed him. It was inevitable that I
go through the same in the restoration process. The nation opposed me, trying to knock me down.
Christianity opposed me, and members who had left the Unification Church opposed me. Those three
groups united in a fight to destroy me. From Satan's standpoint, the nation represented the formation
stage, Christianity represented the growth stage, and the members who had left the church represented the
completion stage. This is why Satan worked through them to attack me. (086-238, 1976/04/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For seven years, beginning in 1953, I prepared for the Holy Wedding. Around that time virtually
everyone opposed me: the nation, Christianity, and even some members. In 1955 I was incarcerated, but
even in prison I fought to lay the foundation for victory. Then in 1957 I began preparing for the Blessing
in earnest. I fasted for 40 days and exhorted the members to evangelize in order to lay a nationwide
foundation. I went on the offensive and expanded our evangelizing activities throughout the nation. I
raised the Unification Church to a new level.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this way, by 1960 I had laid a nationwide foundation and made an impact on the nation. So, although I
was opposed by the nation and by Christianity on the national level, I could proceed with the Holy
Wedding. I had to conduct the Holy Wedding in circumstances similar to those of Jesus when he was
arrested and made to go the way of the cross. Indeed, at the time of the Holy Wedding, the nation opposed
me and Christianity opposed me. They were united against me. (111-199, 1981/02/20)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Holy Wedding took place 15 days after the Engagement Ceremony. It began with the Ceremony
to Restore the Parents through Indemnity. It was followed by the Ceremony for the Parents of Glory.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first ceremony, 12 attendants stood on each side of the aisle. I wore white traditional Korean
attire (chima-jeogori) and a long wedding veil. Father and I descended the stairs from the second floor
together amid the echoing sounds of the choir singing "Song of the Banquet." We then took our places at
the front of the room. Following True Father's prayer and proclamation, representative members offered a
congratulatory address and recited a poem of praise.</p>
<p>Soon, the second ceremony commenced. Father and I were dressed in traditional Korean wedding attire
(samo-gwandae for the groom; hwal-ot for the bride) and headdresses. Father offered a pledge to God,
and all members bowed four times to God and True Parents. We bowed three times facing each other.
Then we exchanged gifts and offered a final bow to each other. Representative members presented a gift
and read a congratulatory address. True Father offered a second pledge to God, and the historic event
concluded with Father raising his hands to offer a benediction upon everyone present. (True Mother,
2013/11/30)</p>
<ol>
<li>Seven hundred members from around Korea were invited to attend the Holy Wedding. Father
distributed tickets stamped with his seal to everyone who attended. He told them, "In the future, with this
ticket even a person who is supposed to go to hell can enter heaven." I believe those words were meant to
emphasize the preciousness of True Parents' Holy Wedding, and that Father wanted the people who were
there to treasure the value of that moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ceremonial table for the Holy Wedding had been prepared according to instructions revealed by
heaven. It was a large table with 40 different kinds of food. Father and I ate together and the wedding
festivities took place.</p>
<p>We changed out of our wedding attire and put on Korean traditional clothes. I danced merrily with Father.
After Father sang, he requested a song from me. He then chose some members to sing, and we all sang
together.</p>
<p>The Holy Wedding was the ceremony that inaugurated the True Parents of humankind for the first time in
human history, but it was held in a humble setting. Considering the providential value and significance of
the occasion, all people of the world should have celebrated it, offering their congratulations and praising
God. (True Mother, 2013/11/30)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>O Heaven, may you lift up the flag of victory! O Earth, may you offer the gift of joy in front of
Heavenly Father! Heavenly Father, I know that on this occasion heaven and earth are together in oneness
offering glory, glory, and infinite glory to You. May all future generations keep and cherish this
auspicious occasion. Father, let the drums roll, and let us march forward on and on into Satan's world to
quickly bring back all of Your children to You as brave people who are restored. I sincerely hope and
pray that You will enable us to become children who can pledge and vow to commit ourselves with all of
our hearts, and even our blood and flesh. Please welcome this daughter who was anointed here today, and
guide her to become Your daughter who can sever all bitter sorrow and pain, by enabling her to wear the
olive laurel wreath of victory. (150-113, 1960/03/27)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can never describe the heart of God, who has been preparing everything for this day, the day of the
Holy Wedding. I am so overwhelmed by our Heavenly Fathers love, having sent me as His daughter to
this place so that we can fulfill the Will and conclude 6,000 years of providential history. I just do not
know what to say. Until the day when we have fulfilled the Will, I pledge that I will advance with you
members in oneness of heart and in all aspects of life. (True Mother, 1960/04/11)</p>

<h2 id="section-3-the-seven-year-course-and-the-birth-of-true-children">Section 3. The Seven-Year Course and the Birth of True Children</h2>
<h3 id="the-seven-year-course">The seven-year course</h3>
<p><em>True Parents' Holy Wedding was performed on the foundation of 14 years of indemnity. The
following seven years was the period in which True Parents' family had to set a condition to be
free from Satan's invasion and complete the foundation of the original family that could enter the
realm of God's direct dominion.</em></p>
<p><em>At the Holy Wedding, True Parents' family went beyond the completion level of the growth stage.
During the following seven years, they had to go through the completion stage while fighting
against and prevailing over attacks from the spiritual world and the physical world. At the same
time, that seven-year course was the period during which True Mother had to set the indemnity
condition of absolute obedience to God's Will and during which she was responsible to become
absolutely one with True Father. For True Father, this seven-year course was the period to raise
True Mother to the standard of perfection and thus establish the foundation of a partnership
centered on God's Will. In short, it was the period in which True Father and True Mother had to
unite as one in faith and love, as well as substantially in body.</em></p>
<p><em>It was also the period during which the blessed families had to go through their first seven-year
course. True Parents led their family and the blessed families as they pioneered the seven-year
course of the completion stage, a path never before trod in human history. Finally, they
prevailed.</em></p>
<p><em>As True Parents went through this seven-year course of internal indemnity, they instituted
Parents' Day, Children's Day and the Day of All Things to recover what had been lost due to the
Human Fall. The ensuing proclamation of God's Day on January 1, 1968 completed this
foundation of victory.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>What did I do until 1960? Like Jacob, I walked a 14-year course. Thus, although the 7 years starting in
1960 is the first 7-year course for you, for me it is the last part of my 21-year course. Through this 7-year
course, we need to create the heavenly fortune that will enable us to successfully reach out to the people
of this nation. During the first three years, God wanted us to establish the internal standard of the family,
and during the remaining four years, He wants us to establish the external standard in our relations with
society.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order for us to accomplish this, I had to make the conditions to establish my family as the
representative of all families, of the nation and of the world. For this latter purpose, I set up the Day of All
Things, and upon that foundation I established holy grounds throughout the world. (017-135, 1966/12/11)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus should have been able to establish a road of victory based on unity with Joseph's family,
representing David's tribe, and then restore through indemnity the nation of Israel without opposition
from the people. But he was not able do so. Hence, the Unification Church is now working to indemnify
this. This is why I am trying to establish the Unification tribe by restoring individuals, families and clans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Centering on the Unification tribe, I set up the first seven-year course and worked to fulfill the mission of
restoring the people of the Republic of Korea. Now that we have laid this foundation, Korea cannot block
the path of the Unification Church. I am saying that through this condition, we now stand in the position
of having restored a realm that Jesus wanted to achieve in his time, from which we can launch a new
world with the authority of Jesus' resurrection. By completing the first seven-year course, we set an
indemnity condition on the level of the Korean people to establish the foundation to restore the nation,
which is what Jesus had hoped to do in his time. (019-165, 1968/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to dissolve bitter pain and sorrow, the events that caused them must be cleared up and
indemnity must be paid. This is why there must be a course in order to complete restoration. I went
through a course of struggle to restore and perfect Adam and laid the foundation for his victory; hence, I
can stand tall as a man. Likewise, in order for Mother to stand tall as a woman, she as Eve must go
through the course of restoration through indemnity. This requires her to undergo a course of battles in
heart, in body and in faith that no one else can fathom. The path that Mother had to pioneer was as
dangerous as walking a tightrope.</li>
</ol>
<p>While she was completing that indemnity by the end of her first seven-year course, we instituted Parents'
Day, Children's Day and Day of All Things. Then, on January 1, 1968, we welcomed God's Day.
Thereby, Mother finally gained the qualification as the original woman on earth and stood in a position
equal to mine on the family level. (059-284, 1972/07/27)</p>
<ol>
<li>After paying indemnity to complete my individual course, I established my family in 1960 and entered
the path of the cross on the family level. Since I had to fulfill the mission of indemnifying the 6,000 year
history of the providence, I focused on paying indemnity to carry the cross on the family level more than
on you and the church.</li>
</ol>
<p>While pursuing this path I instituted Parents' Day, Children's Day and Day of All Things, and when I
completed it, I instituted God's Day. You cannot fathom the internal tribulations Mother and I had to face
and deal with from 1960 until I proclaimed God's Day on the first day of 1968. By winning a victory in
the fight against Satan, I laid the foundation to secure the family level. (030-334, 1970/04/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>During the period of the first seven-year course, we the Parents struggled internally before heaven and
earth. We paid indemnity to clear up all the tangled bitterness and sorrow that originated from the Fall.
This was the period when we could resolve and clear up all the historical circumstances that arose from
Adam and Eve's mistakes in the area of lineage. To move forward, we had to sort out relationships that
could be offered to heaven, offered for the sake of the Will not only in mind but also in body. This is how
we were finally able to complete the first seven-year course and True Parents could emerge into the world
with victory. (077-215, 1975/04/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Unification Church launched its activities in earnest in 1960, on the basis of attending Mother.
Despite persistent opposition from the nation and from Christianity, you laid the foundation to push
through that opposition so you could welcome Mother and attend her.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this did not mean that Mother could just live with me right away. Just as you had to go through
a three-year period of separation after your marriage Blessing, we too had to do dispensational work in
order to secure our family. The path of the Principle is the same for everyone.</p>
<p>During the first seven-year course I had to indemnify all the complicated problems within the first family,
that of Adam and Eve. Thus, the first seven-year course was the period in which to establish the family-
level foundation, centering on Mother. Since Adam and Eve fell in the completion level of the growth
stage, we had to pass through that level to enter the completion stage. (106-267, 1980/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>What has God been doing for the past 6,000 years? What has been His unchanging desire throughout
history? It has been to find the one person, True Mother. It is to find her through Adam, after re-creating
him and sending him to earth. This is re-creation. Originally, God created Adam and then created Eve
from Adam; therefore, for re-creation, Adam has to come to earth first and then find Eve. In other words,
he must find and establish Mother.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to do this, during the first seven-year course I had to put Mother on a path that would enable her
to break away from any condition by which Satan's world could accuse her. This means that she does not
need to fight directly with Satan; instead, Mother just has to have absolute faith in me and always unite
with me. Then Satan cannot invade her.</p>
<p>Adam lost Eve because he failed to fulfill his responsibility. Thus, it is Adam who must set the standard
of victory, by restoring his position in relation to Eve as well as bringing Satan to submission. I am
fulfilling this purpose during this seven-year period. Moreover, having established this standard, I have to
raise Mother, in the position of Eve, to that standard in heart and spirit. This is how we can reverse
through indemnity the failure of the fallen parents. This is how we will secure the foundation of the True
Parents. (017-322, 1967/04/10)</p>
<ol>
<li>Had Adam and Eve not fallen, they would have completed this first seven-year course. This was the
path they were required to go to become the True Parents. Therefore, no matter what accusations Satan
threw against us, Mother and I had to make a breakthrough during this time period. I paved this path,
leading the way as the representative of the family during the first seven-year course. During this period,
we, Father and Mother, had to unravel all the tangles of history.</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, this seven-year course was the time when I had to reverse Eve's dominion over Adam and
completely secure Adam's authority. For this, I had to educate Eve. In other words, during this period I
had to educate Mother in such a way that she would set a standard of absolute obedience and compliance
before me, even at the cost of her life. (073-245, 1974/09/22)</p>
<ol>
<li>It was not easy for us to secure the family of True Parents. We had to rise all the way to the highest
position in the world. We had to pass through the formation, growth and completion stages. There was a
seven-year course to reach the completion stage. Since Adam and Eve fell away at the completion level of
the growth stage, my family had to walk a seven-year course beginning from that point. Until the
establishment of God's Day on January 1, 1968 Mother had to travel an arduous path as a woman. She
passed heaven's tests without any problem, and this is why she could become what she is today, our great
Mother. (170-034, 1987/11/01)</li>

<h3 id="establishing-the-four-position-foundation">Establishing the four-position foundation</h3>
<p><em>After the Holy Wedding 14 True Children were born in True Parents' family, starting with the
first daughter, Ye-jin nim, and the first son, Hyo-jin nim. With the births of their first daughter
and their first son, True Parents completed the four-position foundation that Jesus had not been
able to establish. The completion of the four-position foundation in True Parents' family was a
milestone in the providence of restoration that people need to replicate and realize in their own
families.</em></p>
<p><em>Even as she gave birth to her children, True Mother shared the same heart as other church
members who were working on the front line. She lived a humble life, eating meager meals of
steamed barley mixed with a small amount of rice, something usually only poor people ate
because they could not afford white rice.</em></p>
<p><em>The church members, as the Cain-type children, needed to become one in heart with the True
Children and thus set the condition to be reborn with the same rank, as if they were twins. To
have them meet this condition, at the dedication ceremonies for Ye-jin nim and Hyo-jin nim, True
Parents distributed three kinds of gifts to the members as three conditions of offering, and fed
them three kinds of food: rice, seaweed soup and milk.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Through the birth of my sons and daughters, the path has been paved for all of you to be reborn. In
order to be reborn, you have to go through a ceremony that establishes the same conditions as if you had
been nursed on True Mother's milk. So, following Ye-jin's birth, a ceremony was held throughout Korea
in which all members ate some seaweed soup with rice in it. This ceremony was also held when our son
Hyo-jin was born. These ceremonies set the condition that you also were born from True Mother when
she gave birth to those children. (054-225, 1972/03/24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You all should establish the condition that you existed as seeds within me that were yet to be born,
and that then you were reborn through True Mother's womb. You cannot be born on your own, so a
condition has to be fulfilled by which you are born alongside my children. For this purpose, at the birth of
both my first son and first daughter we held a ceremony during which you ate seaweed soup with rice in
it. The first occasion was when Ye-jin arrived. Ye-jin is our first daughter. By paying the necessary
indemnity, I established the condition so that all women who participated in that ceremony were reborn
through True Mother's womb. As a matter of fact, all of you must conduct your own ceremonies in which
you resolve to unite with her for three years. Hyo-jin is our first son, and the men must go through the
same ceremony.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, all women should celebrate Ye-jin's birthday as the birthday of their Abel, and all men should
celebrate Hyo-jin's birthday as the birthday of their Abel. Then you need a conditional period in which
you become one with him or her substantially. (054-274, 1972/03/25)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before the end of the 4th lunar month of this year 1963, all the entanglements of heart among church
members should be resolved. And then you must pray for blessings upon your enemies. This is a period
when any member who left the church before 1962 will be given the opportunity to return. By doing this
we can set the condition to command Satan's world to open the gate to us. Because I know this time is
coming, I do not hate my enemies. Today is the 21st day since Hyo-jin's birth. On this day, you should
rejoice over him more than Mother and I do. (012-131, 1963/01/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the title "True Parents" to be established, there has to be a basis to bring oneness among the
children. Because the first human beings fell, there are two kinds of children in the world: internal
children and external children, or Abel and Cain. From this perspective, the birth of our daughter Ye-jin
and our son Hyo-jin between 1961 and 1963 made a profound contribution to the Providence of
Restoration. Their birth and your oneness with them brought about the Day of All Things. And on the
foundation of their birth, when the first seven-year course came to an end, I was able to proclaim God's
Day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ever since 1968, following the end of that first seven-year course, it was possible for the Unification
Church to begin to develop normally. The proclamation of God's Day has the same significance as Adam
and Eve reaching the completion stage in the Garden of Eden without having fallen. (069-301,
1974/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>Since Jesus was rejected by the people of Israel, a difficult job lies ahead at his Second Advent. He
needs to restore you to your original position. Of course, since you were already born in the flesh and
have grown up to become adults, you cannot return to the position of a seed within the body of perfected
Adam. Therefore, you need to establish the condition to be born again by uniting with True Children who
were born from True Parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a principle that through Cain's complete surrender to Abel, both can be restored. Since the True
Children were born free of original sin, they stand in the Abel position. Accordingly, you in the Cain
position need to unite completely with the True Children. By uniting with them you will become
resurrected children and receive the same benefit they receive.</p>
<p>For this reason, when True Children without original sin are born from the True Parents, you have to
establish the condition of having shared the same food and received the same things as they. You should
do this so that you go through the course of participating in the True Children's position.</p>
<p>Through whom can you make the condition to unite with the True Children and be reborn as a child? It is
not only through True Father; that is not enough. You absolutely must go through the True Parents. No
matter how important Father is, you cannot be reborn unless you go through both the Parents and their
children. (055-119, 1972/04/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>For three years, from 1960 to 1963, all the blessed families in Korea went through the course of
restoration on the national level. Since the national-level foundation was lost in Jesus' time, all members
in the church left home and participated in mission activities to restore the nation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During that time, as they worked on the front line, Father and Mother joined them in heart by eating the
same meager food. When we ate, we did not place our food on the table but on the floor, just as many
members did. When we did so, we had even the child inside True Mother's womb set the condition of
participating with other church members to make the condition to restore the nation. (054-225,
1972/03/24)</p>
<ol>
<li>Some of you here must have eaten seaweed soup when Ye-jin and Hyo-jin were born. This was to
make a condition that both Cain and Abel were born together. You blessed families are in the position of
Cain, so you must attend the True Children in the position of Abel as if they were God or even higher.
You must attend them more sincerely than you attend True Parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not look at this from a secular viewpoint. Actually, you have been united with them from the time
when both of you were in the womb. You should have been born like twins. As twins, you should restore
the authority of the elder son. As Perez and Zerah reversed their positions as twin sons in the womb of
Tamar, you should reverse your position with a particular True Child. As soon as he or she is born, you
should bring your blessed family to connect with that child with absolute faith, absolute love and absolute
obedience.</p>
<p>These should not be just words. Since God created human beings with absolute faith, absolute love and
absolute obedience, unless you blessed families engraft to the True Parents by demonstrating the same
elements of absolute faith, love and obedience in your own circumstances, you cannot create the realm of
partnership with the people around you. (308-256, 1999/01/10)</p>
<ol>
<li>You cannot enter True Mother's womb, so you must become one with True Parents' infant children.
For three years you need to be in the position of a baby inside the womb. This is why I gave you these
mottoes for the three years from 1960 to 1962: first, "Let this be the year of the best result of our lives,"
second, "Let us become Heavenly Father's representatives," and third, "Let us become people who have
something to show and who can be proud of ourselves." What I mean by "show and be proud of" is the
restoration of the four-position foundation by restoring many people.</li>
</ol>
<p>Centered on the three stages expressed in my mottoes, all of you must make the condition of eating and
living together with the babies in True Mother's womb. For those three years, Mother ate barley rice, the
same as you did on the front line. When you went out to do church activities, she participated alongside
you in the same activities. Ye-jin and Hyo-jin were born when Mother was making the same conditions
you were making. In other words, Mother lived with the same heart as all of you. (035-228, 1970/10/19)</p>
<ol>
<li>The archangels were supposed to attend, serve and honor Adam and Eve from the moment they were
created until the time they were married. But the angelic world failed to attend Adam and Eve and
became fallen. The bitter sorrow and resentment thus created by the angelic world must be resolved. For
this reason, you need to have three spiritual children and guide them to attend your own children from the
time they are within the womb. Otherwise, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</li>
</ol>
<p>You cannot enter the kingdom of heaven with only your own children. Had you established the indemnity
condition of gaining three spiritual children before you received the Blessing, your own children would
not need to have their lineage restored. If you are unable to achieve this condition before you go to the
spirit world, it will become a stumbling block for you.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, I already had made all the required conditions of restoring spiritual children while my
children were in their mother's womb. After their birth, you were given seaweed soup, milk and rice. That
was the condition I set up for all of you to have the same birth as the True Children. (023-316,
1969/06/08)</p>
<ol>
<li>Until 1963, True Parents worked with you, sharing your situation and eating humble meals of barley
rice. We had to set that indemnity condition for three years on the family level. At the same time, you had
to go out and struggle to give birth to your spiritual children. Just as you ate barley rice, True Parents also
had to eat it. Now we will have to offer our sons and daughters internally when we go to America for a
course of sacrifice on the world level. This is what we have to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of you ate seaweed soup with rice after Ye-jin was born; it was as if you were receiving blood from
Mother while inside her womb. As Mother ate soup with rice in it, you ate the same food, which was like
receiving her blood. It was the same when Hyo-jin was born. Based on this foundation, I established
Children's Day and then the Day of All Things. It was because we attained such a standard that I had the
foundation to establish these holy days of blessing. Thereupon, when the first seven-year course came to
an end and True Parents' family was liberated, I instituted God's Day. (047-340, 1971/08/30)</p>
<h2 id="section-4-true-parents-completion-of-the-providence">Section 4. True Parents' Completion of the Providence</h2>
<h3 id="the-proclamation-of-true-parents">The proclamation of True Parents</h3>
<p><em>After the Holy Wedding and the subsequent seven-year course, True Parents formed the True
Family and established the four-position foundation on the family level. On that foundation, they
went through the eight stages to complete their mission, thus creating the foundation to establish
and build the kingdom of heaven. As the providence of restoration progressed, they set indemnity
conditions appropriate to each period of time and accomplished them. After each one, they
conducted a corresponding proclamation ceremony so that Satan could not invade it.</em></p>
<p><em>After True Parents had thus prevailed in the history of the providence of restoration through
indemnity, by 1992 the foundation of the True Family was such that they finally could proclaim
before the public that they were the True Parents of humankind. On August 24, 1992, at the
celebration banquet of the 1st World Culture and Sports Festival, True Father officially declared
in front of the assembled world leaders, "At the Women's Federation for World Peace Leaders'
Assemblies that were held in five major cities of Korea in early July of this year, I proclaimed
that my wife, Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon, and I together are the True Parents of humanity, the Savior,
the Lord of the Second Advent and the Messiah."</em></p>
<p><em>By holding marriage Blessings, True Parents have been carrying out the great revolutionary
work of changing the lineage of all people to the true lineage of God. These Blessings have been
interracial, interreligious and international in scope. True Parents come with the true love, life
and lineage of heaven. They alone are aware of the providential timetable for holding these
events, and they are completing the providence of human salvation in accordance with that
timetable.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Christianity opposed me after World War II; hence, during the following 40 years I had to completely
restore through indemnity what John the Baptist failed to do. I had to restore the failure of Christianity;
otherwise, I would have had no way to find and install the Bride. So, by paying indemnity for more than
40 years, I completely restored the failure of John the Baptist and the Christian cultural sphere. This work
was to restore America and reclaim it from Satan. That is why True Mother went to the United States
Congress and proclaimed "True Parents and the Completed Testament Age." She did the same at the
United Nations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The United Nations originally was meant to represent the free world, which had lost the foundation to
receive the Bride. Mother is the Bride. Hence, when she proclaimed True Parents throughout America and
at the United Nations, America and the free world had to unite with her. Fortunately, there was no
opposition. Although she made that bold proclamation about True Parents and the Completed Testament
Age, all audiences were moved to applaud her. (249-109, 1993/10/08)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Fall of the first human ancestors caused the loss of the four great realms of heart and the three
great kingships. Now, finally we are liberated to lift up the name of True Parents. We reached that
position 47 years after World War II, after indemnifying all the failures of history. The lonely path of the
heart that Mother followed her whole life was entirely to prepare for this one day, when she would fulfill
the mission she was destined for.</li>
</ol>
<p>In April 1992, Mother took the first step when, as chairwoman of the Women's Federation for World
Peace, she proclaimed to the world that the True Parents had come to earth to embrace all the families of
humankind and bring liberation to the women of the world. Then in July 1992, she proclaimed that the
True Parents had come, and that she and I are the Messiah, the Savior, the Returning Lord and the True
Parents of humankind. By making these proclamations, Mother prepared a zone for providential
settlement in which to build the one axis in a world that lacks a center and whose families lack a
framework that gives them hope; all this was done at a time when the international situation was chaotic.
Because she made these conditions in a manner that was acceptable to God, the era when we could
proclaim the liberation of Mother and the second generation was ushered in. (241-249, 1992/12/26)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Korea is the land to which the Lord is to return. The Lord at the Second Advent whom Christians have
been expecting is none other than I. Today, July 3, 1992 is the first time I am announcing this in public.
For the first time, I am putting it in writing, in order to let the world know who the Lord at the Second
Advent is. What did I write? Sun Myung Moon! I wrote this for the first time. Now that I have made this
official announcement, you need to clearly understand what it means. From now on, everything will be
revealed. (232-109, 1992/07/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In August 1992, during the World Culture and Sports Festival at the Little Angels' Performing Arts
Center, in front of the approximately 1,000 prominent leaders from around the world, including heads of
state who were participating in the eight events of the festival, I proclaimed, "I am the Messiah, the Savior
and the True Parent." Even so, they nodded their heads; no one shook their heads in objection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am traveling all over the world. Don't you think I know what to say about the current political scene? In
fact, no one has deeper insight or a better brain for dealing with this transitional era than I do. The world
recognizes this about me. That is why I must let the world know what is happening. Unless I proclaim
who I am in public, I cannot take root in the world.</p>
<p>It is only after their wedding that people can be officially recognized as husband and wife. Accordingly, I
traveled throughout the nation and held banquets where I made proclamations about who we are. This
was so that True Parents can settle; then heaven and earth can also settle. To found a nation, it is not
enough just to select the members of the cabinet. The founder must proclaim himself to the public. That is
why I proclaimed that we are the Messiah, the Lord at the Second Advent and the True Parents.
Henceforth, we will build our foundation. (243-168, 1993/01/03)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Centering on God, I proclaimed that we are the True Parents of humankind. I proclaimed worldwide
that the unfallen True Parents who can liberate humankind have come to this world. Now that True
Parents have emerged, their children also can become true parents; and all those who receive their
teachings likewise can become true parents. Due to the Fall, the term "true parents" vanished and the
persons who could have become true parents disappeared. (322-250, 2000/05/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My encounter with Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union was equivalent to Jacob's encounter with
Esau in the Old Testament Age. I represented the United States, Japan and Korea in the position of Jacob,
and Gorbachev represented the Soviet Union, China and North Korea. We met, and I planted God's true
love in his heart. This meant Jacobs return to his hometown. Now the only remaining thing for Esau to do
is to unite with his younger brother and attend the Heavenly Parent. He needs to bring his communist
nations to unite with the younger brother nations of the free world and attend the Heavenly Parent; it is
the only way for the communist world to survive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This was an event without precedent since the beginning of history. It was a new beginning to bring
victory for heaven's side. For this reason, now that I have returned to Korea, I am holding this Rally
Welcoming True Parents, to proclaim True Parents to the people of the Republic of Korea. (204-144,
1990/07/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Now that True Parents have been proclaimed to the world, the cosmos is approaching a turning point.
For the cosmos to follow True Parents, it must have true children, true clans and true peoples. Now that
you have been proclaiming True Parents throughout the world, it is time for you, as their true children, to
proclaim the true family. Your proclamations should not be limited to the family level. Since the First
Adam and the Second Adam were not able to complete their missions, to indemnify this you need to
expand the realm of tribal messiahship. Therefore, all of you need to conduct events to proclaim True
Parents while taking the position of true parents to your tribes. That is how you can build the foundation
to bring change on the national level and the world level. (202-178, 1990/05/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus strove to fulfill the work that Adam failed to do, but he was not able to complete it. Since Jesus
passed away before he could do this, the Lord of the Second Advent, who comes as the perfected Third
Adam, is required to rectify the failures that occurred at the time of the First Adam and Second Adam and
complete their unfinished work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Originally, all humankind should have been the descendants of the First Adam. Even though the First
Adam failed, had Jesus not died on the cross, this world would have been filled with Jesus' sons and
daughters. The world would have become one world by now. Had Jesus not died but married and given
birth to sons and daughters, the members of his clan, in the position of the elder son, would have inherited
the kingship on this earth for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Democracy is a siblings' ideology. It is not Parentism. Siblings compete and fight to get what they want.
They fight because they have no parents to be centered on. That is why humankind must turn to
Parentism. True Parents need to come in order to solve the problems throughout the world that came into
existence due to the siblings' ideology. (224-054, 1991/11/21)</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve fell in their teenage years. The Fall was a problem of love
between a man and woman. Since that is the seed that was sown, now that the harvest time has arrived
worldwide, the problems of promiscuity among young people and family breakdown have become
serious.</li>
</ol>
<p>All humankind is bewailing this reality, yet no real owner has stepped up to take responsibility for it.
Therefore, True Parents, the original owners of creation, must come. When they do, everything that was
defiled by the false parents can be resolved. In the Last Days, all these problems will face judgment.
Individuals, families, peoples, nations, the world and the cosmos on God's side will establish a new
viewpoint centering on True Parents. Then we will undoubtedly recover the world where everything in
heaven and on earth is united as one. For this to happen, True Parents must emerge and bring true love,
true life and true lineage. (362-158, 2001/12/12)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Messiah is the True Father. Because the Fall occurred, the false parents emerged and all human
beings have been born from their false lineage; therefore, the providence of salvation is not an easy task
to fulfill. No matter how many times the blood of the false lineage is purified, it cannot be purified
completely. That is why the salvation of human beings remains incomplete even after tens of millions of
years.</li>
</ol>
<p>God cannot undo what was defiled by the false parents. The ideal of creation is that human beings
complete their portion of responsibility, inherit God's lineage and bequeath it to their descendants. Adam
and Eve destroyed the ideal of creation. Therefore, Adam and Eve must restore it. No one else can rectify
it; not even God. That is why True Parents must come and restore it through indemnity.</p>
<p>What went wrong must be turned around to the original state. This is called restoration through
indemnity. Restoration cannot be done by following a natural course. It must be done by taking the
reverse course in order to return to the original state. Without going through such a course of restoration
through indemnity, there is no way for human beings to return to the original world. Not for eternity.
(334-035, 2000/09/27)</p>
<ol>
<li>You do not understand the difficult circumstances I have faced until now. Ninety-nine out of 100
people would have given up and run away. That is how fearful and serious my position was. However, I
did not budge even one inch. This is because I regarded it as my destiny. Had the path been easy, I am
sure that Satan would have taken it first. I went on a path that even Satan did not dare to go. This is how I
have expanded my scope from the family to the tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a true man, I am positioned as the mediator between God and human beings in a world disconnected
from God. I am to bring God back to them by building God a highway. On it, God will descend from the
level of the cosmos to the world, to nations, peoples, tribes and families. The place where God descends
and dwells is the realm of the True Parents. Now I have established a realm that Satan cannot invade.
(248-037, 1993/05/30)</p>
<ol>
<li>I was not born as a prince of a fabulous kingdom. No one recognized who I was. Few ever imagined
that the Lord would return to Korea, a small nation scarred from numerous wars. The Lord of the Second
Advent comes at a time when the four realms that emerged as a result of Jesus' death on the cross-
democracy and communism, and Islam and Christianity -- are enemies to each other. Their conflicts
having reached the world level, the Lord has to deal with them and bring them into unity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed, this is what I have done. I have finished my part. In order to come this far, I had to deal with
many complex situations behind the scenes. They were incomparably more difficult than what a typical
family has to deal with. They were incomparably more difficult than even the ordeals that nations have to
deal with. Nevertheless, I worked patiently to deal with them and overcame every challenge I faced along
the way. (249-085, 1993/10/08)</p>
<ol>
<li>When the Lord comes again, he needs to unite the world that is now divided between the left wing and
the right wing. He also must unite the religions of the world. That is why I have been forging unity
between the left wing and the right wing, and among religions. Neither the United States government nor
the government of the Soviet Union is doing this. The Lord to come needs to fulfill what Jesus was not
able to fulfill in his lifetime. Otherwise, he cannot turn the world around.</li>
</ol>
<p>Human history does not proceed randomly; it proceeds hand in hand with God's providence. Since my
coming, the providence and history have advanced side by side. I can testify that God is alive and
working in human history. We are now living in a time when we cannot deny the existence of God. (235-
212, 1992/09/20)</p>
<ol>
<li>Blessed families are in the position of Jesus, and they must restore the nation as Jesus was supposed to
do. Israel was divided between the north and the south. It was divided between the northern kingdom,
composed of ten tribes, and the southern kingdom, with two tribes. Leah and Rachel should have united;
because they were unable to resolve their struggle, the nation was divided into two. Jesus died under
similar circumstances, symbolized by the thief on the left and the thief on the right. The two thieves
represented Cain and Abel on the world level. Thus, when the Lord returns, he needs to change the
situation and bring them into unity. That is how he can establish the realm of victory.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is why, as the person with the mission of the Lord of the Second Advent, I must gain victory over
communism. I had no choice but to become the premier world champion in the fight against communism
and bring about its defeat. Furthermore, I must bring unity to democracy and bring unity to the world,
even by guiding the United States of America. Also, I must unite the worlds of religion and politics. (250-
331, 1993/10/15)</p>
<ol>
<li>True Parents are responsible to connect the realms of indirect dominion and direct dominion. The
question is how to tear down the walls that Satan has erected around individuals, families, tribes, peoples,
nations and the world. God has been working continually to achieve this goal, while Satan has been
challenging God and striving to block God's work. In this way, God and Satan have been confronting
each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Satan persists in confronting God. So, standing between God and Satan, I have been working to remove
Satan. I have to advance the providence to the position where Satan cannot accuse me. That is why I had
to go the path of indemnity, which is the human portion of responsibility. The first human beings failed to
fulfill their portion of responsibility. Satan understands that their portion became the responsibility of the
Messiah. That is why he mobilized all his forces to attack True Parents. All the difficulties we face have
come about because we are breaking down his walls around individuals, families, tribes, peoples, nations,
the world and the spirit world. (131-070, 1984/04/16)</p>
<ol>
<li>People who did good deeds through their devotion to and faith in the major world religions and then
went to the spirit world as good spirits have helped the earthly providence according to God's desire.
Until the present time, the only way they could connect to the earth was through religion. However, now
True Parents have come to earth. They have fought and triumphed over evil, and they have established
God's tradition from the level of the individual to the family, tribe, nation and world. As a result, we are
entering the time of the emancipation of the religious realm.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the scope of True Parents' victory has reached the world level, in the age inaugurated by the
True Parents, religion will disappear. If Adam and Eve had not fallen but become the True Parents of
humankind, religion would not have been necessary. If they had fulfilled their responsibility from the
beginning, they would have united with heaven as one body. Then, their ideal oneness would have been
the basis for all ancestors in heaven to connect with their descendants living on earth whenever they were
needed.</p>
<p>I have done everything necessary to restore through indemnity the realm of the people of Israel as a
chosen people, the realm of worldwide Christianity as a chosen people, and the realm of the cosmic
Unification Church as a chosen people. With that, the age is coming when religion will be liberated from
its responsibility. Then the spirit world and the earthly world will connect directly.</p>
<p>Therefore, even those without religious belief can be connected to the spirit world through the realm of
the chosen people, which passes through religion. The old era is coming to an end. Thanks to True
Parents' victory, even people who do not believe in religion will be able to grow through the Old
Testament Age, New Testament Age and Completed Testament Age, just as people do who are situated
within the realms of the major religions. Hence, the time will come when all their ancestors will come
down from the spirit world to visit their descendants and support them. (202-255, 1990/05/24)</p>
<h3 id="proclamations-of-true-parents-ultimate-unity">Proclamations of True Parents' ultimate unity</h3>
<p><em>In 2010, on the 8th day of the 5th month by the heavenly calendar (June 19) at 2:20 a.m. and the
15th day of the 5th month by the heavenly calendar (June 26) at 3:25 a.m., True Parents
proclaimed in Las Vegas that they had achieved oneness in mind, oneness in body, oneness in
thought and oneness in core with God, vertically, and that they had achieved ultimate unity
horizontally. On that foundation, they declared the completion, conclusion and closure of the Old
Testament, New Testament and Completed Testament Ages, and the advent of the age in which
God is all-immanent, all-transcendent, all-powerful and all-capable.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, on the 17th day of the 11th month by the heavenly calendar (December 11) in 2011, True
Father announced at Cheon Jeong Gung Palace, "Now that all beings in heaven and on earth are
aligned with God the Creators original standard of creation that has now been restored, I
declare the completion, conclusion and closure of the entire providence and the final victory."
Then he proclaimed, "All is finished!"</em></p>
<p><em>On the 17th and 18th days of the 11th month by the heavenly calendar (December 11 and 12) in
2011 at the Ocean Cheon Jeong Gung Palace, True Parents wrote the Proclamation of the Final
Cheon Il Guk Victory, "God and True Parents are completely one. God is complete, perfected
and fulfilled. Aju! Heaven is here. Congratulations! Sun Myung Moon. Aju!"</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, on the 26th day of the 6th month by the heavenly calendar (August 13) in 2012, 21 days
before his Holy Ascension on the 17th day of the 7th month (September 3), True Father, during
his report prayer to our Heavenly Parent made the final official proclamation of his earthly life,
with the following words, "Today, as I have returned the conclusion of the final perfection to You,
Father, I know that up to this moment, I have offered my whole life to You. I am spending this
time now to bring my life to its conclusion, to bring it to a close with utmost devotion, in
accordance with Your Will. May the tribal messiahs be able to fulfill the calling of national
representatives. I have accomplished everything for this. I have completed everything. Aju!"</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Now I am establishing the tradition that no one can match, either mentally or physically. With my
mind fixed on heaven and earth, I am making countless conditions of devotion. When my conditions are
so sincere that they touch both heaven and earth, Satan cannot invade what I am doing. It is mainly those
conditions of devotion that prevent Satan from invading. My conditions enable family members in heaven
and all the spirit persons in heaven to build a bridge to earth, and when those in the spirit world come
down on that bridge and connect to my foundation, Satan cannot oppose them. This means that I have
now laid all the foundations needed to fulfill the Will. (285-303, 1997/06/29)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus far, everyone opposed the path I was taking. America opposed me, the Soviet Union opposed
me, China opposed me, Kim Il-sung opposed me, and all others opposed me. Yet I have overcome them
all. My mission is to defeat the left-wing communists and completely liberate the people in the
communist world. I am working to unite all the people in Satan's realm and bind all humankind together,
based on one standard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now there are no barriers for those on this path. There had been all sorts of barriers, but I tore them all
down. I now have gone through all eight levels, from the individual to God, so that I can make the
environment free of barriers. The unity that I am referring to is unity of the individual, unity of the family,
unity of the tribe, unity of the people, unity of the nation, unity of the world, and unity of heaven and
earth. By tearing down the walls of Satan's world and forming an environment of unity, I am trying to
recover the original fatherland. (241-325, 1993/01/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>I have to represent 4,000 years of history; that is why I have not been able to sleep comfortably for the
past 40 years. I have faced opposition from all people and all nations. During that time, I struggled
desperately to find out how to overcome that opposition on the levels of the individual, family, tribe,
nation, world and cosmos. To overcome those obstacles, I had to take a path completely different from the
paths in Satan's world. While communicating with God, who was with me behind the scenes wherever I
went in heaven and on earth, I tore down the walls of Satan's world one by one. By breaking down all the
walls, I built a highway from the individual level to the levels of the family, tribe, people, nation, world
and all of heaven and earth. These efforts restored human beings to the positions of Adam and Eve before
they fell.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now God can be with us wherever we go. I recovered this position for humankind. Heaven's world is
advancing, and Satan's world is retreating. Satan cannot interfere with God's world any longer. Whenever
heaven advances, Satan has no choice but to surrender. (244-208, 1993/02/07)</p>
<ol>
<li>I broke down all the walls in front of me -- eight levels of walls from the individual and family to the
nation and beyond. Over the past 40 years, I have prepared the path for Adam and Eve to return, so they
can move back and forth. Now that path is complete. It is a path that will remain even after I have
returned to God.</li>
</ol>
<p>Numerous religions and nations opposed me, but I did not oppose them. Yet I did not die; I am still alive.
Now I have finished everything. Therefore, even if I die now, it doesn't matter. This is because the truth I
have brought will continue to exist. The Principle will remain; it is the teaching that was declared
victorious at the trial in God's court. Even Satan cannot deny it. (235-248, 1992/09/20)</p>
<ol>
<li>Adam should complete restoration in his own generation. Since all the issues of restoration must be
resolved within True Parents' generation, you have no idea how busy we are.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is why we conduct proclamation ceremonies. Through these ceremonies, we plant flags to make God
the owner. Once we plant a flag, God and True Parents have the authority of dominion over that territory;
it no longer belongs to Satan's domain. That is why, when we returned to Korea after traveling to Russia
and America, we made proclamations throughout the nation. By so doing, we drove in posts, to signify
that we prepared an environment in which the people of Korea would not oppose us but would welcome
us. After we did this, Satan had to retreat.</p>
<p>If people believe these proclamations and come into the realm of these proclamations, then Satan cannot
take them away. It is as if a person who formerly lived without a nationality joins a nation with a newly
drawn national boundary and lives in accordance with the laws of that new environment; then he or she
can belong to its people. (329-267, 2000/08/11)</p>
<ol>
<li>A problem would arise in the spirit world as well as on earth if I did not disclose that I am the one
who comes into the world with God's Divine Seal as the True Parent, the Savior, the Messiah and the king
of peace, the one long sought by humanity. That is why I made the proclamation as to who I am. That
proclamation can be likened to proclaiming a constitution that has already been ratified. Those who are
not in accord with it will fall behind, and those who are in accord with it will move forward and remain
forever.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have become the standard for perfection on all levels; my position is above the constitution, just as the
constitution is above all other laws. Therefore, I must disclose everything, without hiding anything. I have
not done it yet, but by the time I leave earth, I should be able to say, "I have finished everything." I should
be able to say that everything I did and all that I connected with in my surroundings had a reason and a
purpose for the fulfillment of the Will.</p>
<p>Then, when I go to the spirit world, I should be able to begin taking firm root there. Earth also will unite
in partnership with the spirit world, and together they will form the kingdom of peace. What I am saying
is serious. I have come this far, pouring out my utmost devotion, in order to transcend the realm of life
and death, and to remove death once and for all. I am proclaiming this now for your sake. (504-203,
2005/08/16)</p>
<ol>
<li>God is invisible, yet I must be able to attend Him as the True Parent even better than I would attend
anyone visible to my physical eyes. I have a responsibility to follow the way of light amid the light, to
remove the darkness, and to reach the position where I can liberate all people from the realm of hell. I
must erase Satan's footprints and even his shadow from the realms of the spirit world.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I have completed my portion of responsibility, God should be able to say, "This is My world, My
heaven and My earth." When there is no distinction between day and night, only brightness 24 hours a
day, the sovereignty will belong to God alone, not to Satan. Only after I hand over everything to God can
I declare that the indemnity has been paid and liberation and complete freedom have been achieved. Then
we will be in the realm where the portion of responsibility is fulfilled.</p>
<p>That realm is the realm of liberation. No longer will there be barriers in the spirit world, such as the
barriers between heaven and hell. The steep valleys in the spirit world will be leveled into plains. All
people will be able to live with their ancestors in the spirit world as they please. If you call out to your
ancestors, they will come to you; and after listening to them, you will be able to follow their guidance.
Once I establish this original standard, God should be able to declare, "I have finished everything." Once I
have completed the ideal of creation, it also means that God has fulfilled His portion of responsibility.</p>
<p>The first human beings fell due to their ignorance of the Principle and its laws. Therefore, True Parents
must teach humanity about these things and create the realm of oneness. Then peace will dwell in the
realm of liberation -- the ideal kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven, the realm of the original
homeland. Then the liberation of the fatherland, where everyone attends God, will begin. (598-108,
2008/09/19)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have overcome all the obstacles. When I think about what I have done, it seems like a dream. I
wonder, how could I have done all this? I never thought that it was I who did it, not even in my dreams. It
is God who did it. He prepared everything, inside and out. He set up the entire framework; He trained me
and made foundation upon foundation so that I could complete my work. I am saying that heaven toiled
much more than we can ever imagine. That is why, whatever happens in my life, I live without
complaining. (311-107, 1999/08/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the Fall, human beings lost their original hometown and original fatherland. Yet the planet
Earth is our original homeland; and the place where God dwells is our original fatherland.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Early in my life, I already knew how to become a filial son, a patriot, a saint, a divine son and a king.
When it comes to the fundamental issues, there was nothing that I did not know. That is why I know how
to build the kingdom of heaven on earth and the kingdom of heaven in heaven.</p>
<p>I told you that the era of the Fourth Adam's realm is approaching. On Chil Pal Jeol (7-8 Day), we took
firm root as True Parents. On that basis, on Gu Gu Jeol (9-9 Day) and Sam Shib Jeol (3-10 Day), I
proclaimed the realm of liberation. As the True Parent, I have eliminated everything by which Satan made
himself the false father, and I have recreated the entire basis for God's dominion that Satan destroyed. I
have thereby completed the restoration of everything. By doing so, I have ushered in the era for building
the unified world, the kingdom of heaven on earth based on the ideal of the family.</p>
<p>The original world, the realm which has nothing to do with the Fall, has been empty for thousands of
years, awaiting the Fourth Adam. Now, based on the realm of liberation that I established, this realm will
be filled all at once. The foundation has been completed for God to be liberated, and even for Satan to
receive forgiveness and enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>I too must be liberated. What liberates me is to rescue the people in the dungeons at the rock bottom of
hell and bring them with me to the kingdom of heaven. (313-282, 1999/12/26)</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite receiving persecution my entire life, I have always lived for the sake of others. This is how I
was able to cover all the levels of opposition, from the individual to the family, tribe, people, nation and
world. Not only have I attained perfection as an individual, I also have completed my mission on all eight
levels, including the family, tribe, people, nation, world, cosmos and God. I completed all this, which
never could be done before, not even during 6,000 years of history. Now that it is finished, the world is no
longer in the course of restoration where we must pay indemnity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, if you invest yourself with absolute faith and absolute love, centering on the realm of heart of the
Fourth Adam, you will be elevated accordingly. It is like having a highway that takes you effortlessly to
the front gate of the palace. There is nothing to obstruct you. The only questions are your driving skill and
whether you have fuel. We are in the era when you can drive wherever you want to go, as long as you can
supply the gasoline. (332-042, 2000/09/04)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God has been leading the providence of salvation not just for one generation but for thousands of
years. Biblically speaking, God has been working in history for the restoration of humankind for 6,0 00
years. Four thousand years is the length of time that the history of restoration was centered on the chosen
people of Israel, which did not fully succeed. That period is what I had to restore through indemnity
during the last 40 years. I have given Mother all the fortune I accumulated throughout my life. She, in
turn, had to live her life accepting that I, her husband, am also her grandfather, her father and her older
brother. She has actually lived her life with that standard. This is what makes Mother so wonderful. (256-
219, 1994/03/13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is it that True Parents should accomplish in 2007, a jubilee year of the providence? I came to
earth representing the incorporeal God. I discovered and revealed all the secrets of heaven, earth and
human beings, and brought victory by paying indemnity. Then I passed on my entire victorious
foundation to Mother. On this foundation, Mother held a global speaking tour of 180 nations. Afterward,
with unity between Cain and Abel, she toured 40 nations. The oneness of the family during these tours
was the foundation for the work I did to deal with the providence. All of your families must follow that
path.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider that God is the first generation, Adam was the second generation, and Cain and Abel in Adam's
family were the third generation. Didn't God lose the realm of three generations? So I had to win a victory
that included the third generation, Cain and Abel, which I did. Mother also triumphed in this, thus
bringing victory for Eve's realm. Accordingly, both True Parents, Father and Mother, are victorious. (569-
071, 2007/07/22)</p>
<ol>
<li>I did not mind going to prison. When I went to Pyongyang, I already knew whom I would meet, as if
the meetings had been prearranged. Jesus had 12 disciples, but when he went to prison, they all betrayed
him. In my case, when I was imprisoned I actually found 12 disciples and even more. For restoration
through indemnity, I had to restore all that was lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the future, where should you build a memorial tower to commemorate me? You should memorialize
the places where I experienced prison life. One of those memorials should be at Danbury, where, based on
Mother's unity with me during my incarceration, I proclaimed the realm of ideal oneness between Father
and Mother. (566-183, 2007/06/19)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We, the True Parents, opened a new age by completing, concluding and closing the entire history of
the providence of restoration through indemnity. We opened the era of Cheon Il Guk. Now you need to
reach out and educate your neighbors and people of every nation, to enable them to unite with the Will of
our Heavenly Parent and True Parents. That is the best way to satisfy the debt you owe to God in return
for His love and blessings, and to fulfill your mission for humankind. (True Mother, 2013/10/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 15th day of the 5th lunar month in 2010 was an important date. On that day, Mother and I
together made a final declaration. At that time, Mother and I came to an agreement on matters about
Korea and other matters pertaining to policies. That was when Mother promised that she would unite with
me regardless of what happened. Based on her promise, we made our declaration. Amid the final battle
with the fallen world, Mother and I made a solemn promise centering on God; that event took place at
3:25 a.m. on the 15th day of the 5th month by the heavenly calendar in 2010.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The hour of that proclamation is significant: three represents the three ages of the Old Testament, New
Testament and Completed Testament. In particular, it signifies that this is the third age, the Completed
Testament Age, which must never fail. Thus we stated, "As we welcome the age for the completion,
conclusion and closure of the Old, New and Completed Testaments, we offer and declare the age in which
the ultimate realm of oneness between True Father and True Mother is perfected and consummated, and
the age in which God is all-immanent, all-transcendent, all-powerful and all-capable." (True Mother,
2010/07/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>O Father, every being in heaven and on earth is totally focused on this day, December 11, 2011. On
this day, True Parents perfected, finalized and consummated the original standard of the Creator. Now,
Father, You have become the Owner of earth. Now heaven and earth, Father and children, and the family
and the world can be totally liberated and enter the state of complete freedom. Accordingly, this is the day
to proclaim the perfection, conclusion and consummation of Your victory as the True Parent of the
Cosmos, and Your victorious supremacy in the world according to the ideal of creation. Mansei to God!
Mansei to True Parents!</li>
</ol>
<p>Father, as the prince who brought You victory by enabling the family kingdom to come by establishing
the realm of total oneness between the True God and True Parents, I have accomplished everything that
You asked me to fulfill. Based on all these victories, I proclaim that Your sovereignty is now secured. On
this morning we, the Parents of Heaven and Earth who have become one, thank You for giving us this
chance to proclaim that everything is perfected, liberated and concluded. Aju! (True Mother, 2011/12/11)</p>
<h2 id="section-5-the-way-to-become-true-parents">Section 5. The Way to Become True Parents</h2>
<h3 id="true-parents-are-the-example">True Parents are the example</h3>
<p><em>All human beings were originally supposed to achieve individual perfection within the love of
God, become true husbands and wives and true parents, and form true families. Each true family
creates a special realm in which we can experience, in succession, love for our parents, love
among siblings, love as husband and wife, and love for our children. It is also the fundamental
foundation for completing the purpose of creation.</em></p>
<p><em>Hence, it is the hope of every human being to form a true family. A member of a true family will
grow to become an embodiment of true love, not acting counter to God's desire, hurting others or
abusing the created world. Finally, for the first time since God's creation, True Parents have
fulfilled the ideal of the true family, and thus they have set the example for all human beings of
how to live. All people need to pattern themselves after the tradition of the True Parents of
Heaven and Earth. Throughout their lives, they practiced a life of living for the sake of others by
loving God, loving people, loving their nation and loving all created things.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>True Parents' family is the model for all families. Therefore, True Parents are re-creating all the
families of the world on the horizontal level. Based on the Principle and its laws, they are bringing all
families into unity with God. This way they can realize the four great realms of heart, the three great king-
ships and the realm of the royal family. We first must achieve the authority of the elder son, then the
authority of the parents, the authority of the king, and finally the authority of the royal family. When we
achieve all these, God will be able to go back and forth freely, day and night.</li>
</ol>
<p>My vision of the united homeland is that we all can connect to every level -- from the individual to the
world. Every family should be able to forge connections with all others. When you interconnect as new
families, you can build the original homeland. Upon building such model families, you will be welcomed
wherever you go. It will be as if God is freely traveling with you. (247-334, 1993/06/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>Will you be a happy person when you go to the other world? If many people want to visit you and
spend time with you there, you will be happy. Although you come from different backgrounds, races,
nationalities and living environments, if you participate in a new family structure in which you have
become one in mind and body, one as husband and wife, and one as parents and children and with your
siblings, you will find that everything works out well for you wherever you go.</li>
</ol>
<p>The world that the Unification Church is seeking is one in which we have restored the authority of the
elder son, the authority of the parents and the authority of the king, as well as the four great realms of
heart. Then everyone will be connected everywhere. As new families, you are responsible to become
model families. When your families connect to one another, they will constitute the original homeland.
Then God can be with them.</p>
<p>God likes True Parents. You like True Parents as well. Because you like True Parents as God does, He
should be able to freely enter your life. Thus, your families must be connected to True Parents and
expand. This is how we can build the original homeland. True Parents are building the model family.
Based on that family model, many families will be multiplied. (247-335, 1993/06/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>What the fallen world needs most are True Parents who have prevailed over the fallen realm by
centering on God's original love. True Parents have gone beyond the stage of fulfilling their portion of
responsibility. This is the perspective of the Principle. They have gone beyond the realm of indirect
dominion and have entered the realm of direct dominion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The realm of direct dominion is the world aligned with God's love. Thus, in this realm there can be no
owner other than God. This realm is absolute, because once we become one with God's love, we do not
want another owner. Even as God does not want another owner, human beings do not want any owner but
God. God's love becomes the eternal base.</p>
<p>This is the model True Parents have established. This foundation can be expanded to the family, tribe,
people, nation and beyond. Then heavenly fortune will pour down centering on the axis of God's love.
(149-155, 1986/11/21)</p>
<ol>
<li>The original ideal world that the first human beings were supposed to establish according to the ideal of
creation would have been a world where, centering on God's true love, true life and true lineage, they
would have established the four great realms of heart as true children, true siblings, true husband and
wife, and true parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, our first ancestors did not keep faith in God's Will. Instead, they entered into an illicit
relationship that defiled their lineage and they inherited the evil seed. As a result of their illicit love
relationship, these evil parents passed down the root of evil life and evil lineage to their evil children and
thence to all humankind.</p>
<p>This all started when they were yet in their youth. Youth is the most important period in our life. Young
people today are immersed in fallen love, behaving just as the first ancestors did. Their value system is
reckless and confused. They deny morals and ethics as they pursue free sex and other selfish ends. They
flout the parent-child relationship; they do not value the family. This world has indeed become a hell on
earth.</p>
<p>If we are to create the kingdom of heaven on earth based on God's standard of absolute true love, we must
turn this world around 180 degrees to God's side. The devil destroyed the human family. In order to save
human beings, God had True Parents create the model of one true family through a reverse course. God is
yearning for the world of love and peace that He originally envisioned at the time of creation. (271-148,
1995/08/27)</p>
<ol>
<li>In the world today, families are being destroyed. Parents are losing control, and there is no proper
order. Siblings are divided. The family has no center, and family members are all going their own way. In
order to halt the breakdown of the family, people need the True Parents. By knowing True Parents clearly,
broken families can be healed.</li>
</ol>
<p>This applies not only to the families in today's world; the families of our ancestors must be called back to
earth and restored. This has now become possible. It is called restoration by returning resurrection. The
same applies to your descendants. Once you clearly understand the Principle and make it part of your
daily life, you can protect them and guide them in the right direction. The reason you need True Parents is
to make your family a true family. (237-218, 1992/11/17)</p>
<ol>
<li>God's ideal of creation is to perfect human beings as the models of love through eight stages of life: in
the womb, as an infant, sibling, engaged couple, husband or wife, parents, true grandparents and true king
or queen. This course of life was designed to establish the tradition of true love and to perfect human
beings as models of true love, within the parent-child relationship.</li>
</ol>
<p>The true love, true life and true lineage of the True God are absolute, unique, unchanging and eternal. He
set up the family model, with unchanging true love at the core, in order to bequeath His true love, true life
and true lineage to tens of thousands of future generations.</p>
<p>In the family model, parents and children, husband and wife, and brothers and sisters become one through
true love. It is a son who makes his father an owner of true love; it is a wife who makes her husband an
owner of true love; it is a younger brother who makes his older sibling an owner of true love.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a couple without children cannot establish their position as parents of true love. The
same goes for women with no husband or men with no wife: They cannot establish their positions as
spouses of true love. Likewise, people who have no siblings have no way to establish their siblings as
owners of true love.</p>
<p>In order to become owners of true love, we must lift up others and love them more than we love
ourselves. As individuals, we need to establish mind-body unity, with true love at the center. In the
family, we need to build unity between husband and wife and between brothers and sisters. Then we must
unite nations in the same way. This is how we can create the realm of love through the eight stages and
become model owners of true love. This is how we can build ideal families and ideal nations. From that
point, eternal worldwide equalization can begin. When it does, the kingdom of heaven on earth and in
heaven naturally will arise. (316-245, 2000/02/13)</p>
<ol>
<li>The world of peace will find its beginning when True Parents emerge and educate humanity, showing
the world every aspect of the model family. The international marriage Blessings that True Parents are
conducting throughout the world are more than the marriage ceremony of one religious group. They
constitute a movement to save the nation and the world by establishing the tradition of God's love. This
movement teaches young people the value of maintaining their purity prior to marriage. For adults, it
promotes the marriage Blessing in which they vow to absolutely maintain trust and fidelity between
husband and wife, with God's true love at the center. The marriage Blessing builds up families of true
love, stops family breakdown and sets up cornerstones of peace in nations and around the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Especially with regard to the international cross-cultural marriages, once people from nations that have
politically and historically been enemies overcome their high barriers and relate to each other as in-laws
within these families of true love, they can transcend the boundaries of their national and racial
backgrounds. This is how peace can come. Truly, the high-level formula for creating true peace is to bring
the children of nations that relate to each other as enemies into the realm of the marriage Blessing and
have them wed each other across national and cultural boundaries to build true families of true love that
heaven and earth desire. When enemies accept the cross-cultural marriage Blessing, peace can begin to
unfold.</p>
<p>The formula is the same, whether the conflict is between families, between nations or between ideologies.
In cross-cultural blessed marriages, people can transcend their ideologies and build a world of peace and
happiness far greater than what their ideologies ever envisioned. The eternal world of peace that both God
and humanity long for can begin from this point. (359-140, 2001/11/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have absolute faith in the indemnity course that True Parents are walking and that you walk with
them, when you go to the spirit world it will become a condition by which you can surmount the barriers
of the past. It is because the standard of your attendance to True Parents will connect to the spirit world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, you must live as True Parents have taught you and become one in heart with them, with the
goal of inheriting their true love, true life and true lineage. You must become sons and daughters who are
centered on my thought, aligned with my heart and bonded to my lineage. If you are such sons and
daughters, then when your own children become husbands and wives, they will be the substantial fruit of
God's love and life.</p>
<p>When you become couples, you unite with the realm of heart of the Original Being of dual characteristics.
As the Original Being engages in origin-division-union action through you, the heavenly realm and the
earthly realm unite as one vertically. At the same time, east and west, or right and left, become one
centering on your conjugal love, and when you have children, they will become one with each other in
relationships of older and younger. This is the model of the family, the standard model. There we can
experience all the types of God's love.</p>
<p>When you experience life through your sons and daughters, it is as if you are experiencing God's life, and
when your sons and daughters expand your lineage, you can feel it is the expansion of God's lineage.
Since you are in oneness vertically and horizontally, you become sons and daughters and couples who can
represent God's life. And through you, God's love, life and lineage can connect everywhere on the
horizontal plane. (355-277, 2001/10/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>God is the Owner. God is the Teacher. God is the Parent. This is the three great subject partners
principle. Because of this, becoming the True Parents required that we become the teachers of all
teachers, the owners of all owners and the parents of all parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, if you want to become a true owner, a true parent and a true teacher, you must know the
True God clearly. Centered on the ideal of the True God, you need to teach people how to become true
human beings, how to establish true families, how to build a true nation and how to become true citizens
of that nation. Since you have not known about all this, True Parents are here to guide you to follow the
true path. They teach you how to become true parents. They also teach you how to become true owners.
(216-057, 1991/03/09)</p>
<ol>
<li>At Cheon Jeong Gung Palace, I wrote the following calligraphic precept, "The true, holy and virtuous
Emperor of Cheon Il Guk, reigning over the myriads of people and triumphant on all levels, begets
generations of holy people living in peace and prosperity for whom everything goes well." You need to
carry this motto in your heart as you lead your life. By now, even without anyone's help, you should be
able to know thoroughly the principles of heaven and earth and the formula for the course you need to
follow in your life. Then you will not need any other textbooks. This is the ultimate level you need to
reach. (533-011, 2006/07/18)</li>
<li>True Parents overcame all the challenges they encountered on earth and gained the supreme victory.
Now, along with the inauguration of God's kingship, we have established the world of liberation. This
was achieved by victoriously inaugurating the heavenly nation of God's sovereignty, the united world of
spherical oneness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether or not you fully unite with True Parents at the center will determine the conclusion of the entire
providential history before and after God's creation of the world. You must succeed in uniting with them
in order to receive the seal of approval from God, Jesus and True Parents. This is how you can be truly
liberated.</p>
<p>You as individuals cannot indemnify the things I must resolve. Therefore, instead of that, you must have
absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience in front of True Parents. Your priority should be True
Parents; you must place them above your own personal concepts, possessions and desires. No matter
what, you have to maintain absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience toward them.</p>
<p>You must build a model family that will never leave its position as True Parents' partner, one that works
with them not only on the levels of the individual and the family but on every level up to the nation, the
world and even the cosmos. You need to stand as a subject partner whose blessed marriage is of such a
standard that it can be publicly recognized by all people. Only then can you return to the original world
where the Fall is unknown, the world that manifests the ideal of creation. I mean that you can go to the
united world of all-embracing oneness. (378-173, 2002/05/11)</p>
<ol>
<li>True Parents' family is the model. Individuals and families who emulate that model are free to travel
anywhere. It is the same for the tribe, people, nation and world. All people must unite with that model.
From the family to the world, everyone must inherit True Parents' tradition; this is how they can be
integrated with God and True Parents as their true children. Then they will establish the unified
homeland.</li>
</ol>
<p>The True Parents' family is always the model. For this reason, all of you must unite with it. Even the
world must connect with it. True Parents' family is the model for all your families, but it is also the model
for the whole, having transcended the individual, family, tribe, people, nation and world. Therefore, God
can freely travel back and forth to True Parents' family. This is why everyone must unite with that family.</p>
<p>Moreover, True Parents are the ones who set the tradition from the individual to the family, tribe, people,
nation and world. Hence, from the family to the world, all must inherit that tradition. By doing so they
will be integrated with God and True Parents as their true children. Only then can the unified homeland
be built. To be integrated means you are with them in total harmony.</p>
<p>The term "True Children" means the True Parents' direct children. In modeling yourself after True
Parents' family, you should have the same bond of heart with True Parents as their direct children have.
To become a model means to represent God and True Parents. In order to represent God and True Parents,
you must unite centering on True Parents and their children. This is the condition for unifying the
homeland. (242-312, 1993/01/02)</p>
<h3 id="the-path-to-become-true-parents">The path to become true parents</h3>
<p><em>As a result of Adam and Eve's Fall, we are destined to travel the path of restoration. The only
way to sever our connection to the Fall is to follow in the footsteps of True Parents' model
course. True Parents triumphed over billions of evil spirits and brought them to voluntary
submission. They succeeded because they lived a life of absolute faith, absolute love and absolute
obedience before God.</em></p>
<p><em>True Parents not only prevailed on earth; they also endured the most miserable circumstances to
prevail in spiritual struggles in the spirit world. Thus, in both worlds they have become the
greatest examples of living for the sake of others with absolute faith, absolute love and absolute
obedience before God.</em></p>
<p><em>They allowed us to receive the marriage Blessing, thereby bequeathing their victorious
foundation to all blessed families. All people should inherit True Parents' tradition of true love,
true life and true lineage and become second selves of True Parents. Then they should fulfill their
responsibilities as tribal messiahs and citizens of Cheon Il Guk.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Human beings are born from fallen parents. This is why you find yourselves changing every day,
living in ignorance of your purpose and direction, groaning in despair. However, the path you are destined
to go is not a path that changes from one moment to the next. You must not be fickle -- one way in the
morning and another way in the evening. You need to have the firm belief and conviction that "True
Parents' path is my path; True Parents' daily life is my daily life; where True Parents stand, I will stand;
True Parents' world is my world." And you should be able to say you cherish True Parents more than you
do anyone else in the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>There will be storms on your path while attending True Parents. Yet no matter how furiously the tempests
blow, you should be able to surmount them and even find delight in them. If you do so, you will not be
just dreaming about the restoration of the world in the future; you will be actualizing that united world.
This I why I tell you to become the families who can exemplify True Parents' family and meet the
standard of True Parents' tradition. Your families should be the hope of the future world that all people
have been hoping for. This law does not change. If you are a family who can embody that law, then you
are of the family of True Parents. (044-136, 1971/05/06)</p>
<ol>
<li>You cannot become perfect on your own. You can be perfected simply by the love of your parents.
This is why, once a baby is born in the bosom of its parents, the child takes after the parents. It doesn't
matter whether the parents are good people or bad, handsome or plain.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unification Church teaches that we must meet True Parents and receive their love. For you it is the
blessing of all blessings. The hope of all people is to meet the True Parents. You must meet the True
Parents even if you have to face death along the way. You may lose all of history, all the present era and
even all your future descendants, but if you can meet the True Parents, it is as if you are recovering the
ages of history, the present era and the future. Such is the value of True Parents. Throughout fallen
history, people have longed for one united world. Human beings all cherished in their hearts the hope that
a world of peace would be built on earth at some point in time. (035-237, 1970/10/19)</p>
<ol>
<li>The time has come for our blessed families, centering on True Parents' family, to present the ideal of
the family to the families of humankind throughout the world. This is the era to restore the family.
Therefore, now that we are building exemplary families on God's side, we should teach the right path to
all the families in Satan's world. We should present the one perfect model, surpassing the imperfect
standards of families in the fallen world. This would be a family in which sons and daughters attend their
Heavenly Parent, a wife attends her husband, children attend their parents, and a younger sister serves her
older brother.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I am saying is that all of you should inherit the heart of the vertical Parent and horizontal True
Parents, with true love at the center, and become perfected true children. Then you yourselves can
become true parents. When you fulfill the ideal of perfect siblings that God has envisioned in His heart,
you can become husbands and wives. As married couples, you should become the best among all couples,
perfect in the sense that you are what God has desired to see. When you become parents, you should
become perfect embodiments of God's heart.</p>
<p>True Parents have emerged as the ones who perfectly embody God's heart at each stage: children,
siblings, spouses and parents. They are the ones whom God has awaited and envisioned as the center of
His own family. (240-204, 1992/12/13)</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to place God and True Parents at the center of your life. This is the original standard. After
taking this position, you need to expand it into a new future. You need to build a world that is the
expansion of God and True Parents' family. For this, you need to establish the structure of your own
family based on absolute, original, true love. This is the beginning point of the tradition of God and True
Parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet you are now too distant from this standard. You are going in the wrong direction because of your
many bad habits and worldly concepts. These things become conditions for Satan to accuse you when
God brings the judgment in the future. That is to say, what you must fear most is what you are carrying
within yourself. From now on, you must eliminate all your bad habits and the conditions upon which
Satan could accuse you, and advance to firmly secure the structure of your own true family. (228-023,
1992/03/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>All members who received the Blessing must become true parents. We are now living in the era when
we must bring all the families of the world to become families with true parents. Since we now laid the
foundation to bring unity throughout the world, the time has come for all the blessed people throughout
the world to become true parents, and by doing so to enable others to become true parents.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this, all you blessed wives must first inherit True Mother's tradition. In order to become a true parent,
you need to do so. On behalf of True Mother, you too must experience the pain of childbirth in order to
unite everyone in your tribe at this time of making everyone into true parents. True Mother represents the
Holy Spirit; therefore, she must give birth to all of humankind, but this time not only in terms of the spirit
but also in terms of the flesh. Accordingly, you blessed wives have the responsibility of Mother to give
birth to young adults and even older men, no matter what their age -- every one of the first generation.
You need to resurrect them all.</p>
<p>Second, you need to liberate families and expand the realm of family messiahs. You need to give them
rebirth and liberate them. If you do not give them rebirth, they cannot be resurrected. All human beings
must be reborn. As family messiahs, you must give birth to the families in your clan and bring them into
oneness as your tribe. Then each of you, as a tribal messiah of your own tribe, must bring your tribe into
the realm of the one tribe. Thus, in the position of True Mother, you must give rebirth to families and
tribes and bring them into oneness. This is what is required to reverse through indemnity the failures of
Adam's family and Jesus' family. (248-159, 1993/08/01)</p>
<ol>
<li>Now you need to go over the individual level of Adam and Eve when they lived with God prior to the
Fall, and even beyond their life as a family. You must go further, to fulfill the family ideal at the levels of
the tribe, nation, world and cosmos.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within our own generation, we, the True Parents, had to resolve all the historical entanglements of Adam,
who by falling had become the false parent. Within our generation, we had to resolve humankind's
defilement by the blood of death that began from Satan, a matter whose truth was unknown through all
the ages of history. We had to establish the original foundation as a family with God's love within the
world of heart and the realm of oneness and expand it to the levels of the tribe, people, nation, world and
cosmos. Because we have completed that, we can finally settle.</p>
<p>Starting from Adam and Eve, human beings together with God went through the Old Testament Age, the
New Testament Age and the Completed Testament Age. Only today have we finally settled in the realm
of the Fourth Adam's heart. Your families have inherited a position of liberation that was only attained
now, tens of thousands of years after the time of Adam. Therefore, all of you can now become the
ancestors of your newly formed clans. (519-096, 2006/02/28)</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to fulfill the way of filial children in your family, the way of patriots who live for the
nation, the way of saints who live for the world, and the way of divine sons and daughters who live for
heaven and earth. Your family represents not only your own family; it represents the model for your tribe,
people, nation, world and cosmos. Therefore, you are required to live for the fulfillment of them all.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Adam fell, though he was but one individual, that one moment brought the downfall of all the
billions of people in the future generations of his family. Accordingly, when you restore people through
indemnity, you need to restore each person or family as if they represent multitudes of people. This is the
responsibility of each blessed family.</p>
<p>Thus, with your own merit as the center, each of you blessed families will become the starting point of
new tribes. Satan's world expanded horizontally from individuals to tribes.</p>
<p>Now all people throughout the world should unite by developing the mind-set of world-level individuals
and world-level families and build a common base with True Parents' standard. This is how the world can
come to be perfectly in accord with True Parents' model. On behalf of your entire family, you need to be
in accord with True Parents' example and be willing to offer your body as a sacrifice for the sake of the
world and for the sake of all humanity; then you can receive God's Divine Seal. We as the True Parents
have been working throughout our lives to pioneer that standard and be that example for you. (557-163,
2007/02/27)</p>
<ol>
<li>You must become citizens of the kingdom of heaven. It is the nation of True Father, the nation of
True Mother and the nation of the true elder son. When you are connected to them, you emerge as people
of the kingdom of heaven. Each of you is a citizen, a son or daughter, and an owner of the kingdom of
heaven. It is in the family that you begin to become owners of the kingdom. From there you can enter the
realm of the royal family.</li>
</ol>
<p>A filial child is the owner of his or her family, and a patriot is the owner of his or her nation. These must
connect together as one; they must go in one direction on the same path. A filial child, a patriot, a saint
and a divine son or daughter all move in the same direction on the same path. There is no other path. God
wants you to follow a single path.</p>
<p>In the very beginning, you must become a filial child. You must become a person to whom God would
say, "I absolutely need you. I am going to be with you whether you are in hardship or in happiness."
Become the person He wants to be with, all through your life. No matter how much you are rejected and
persecuted, you must keep following this one path. Once you become a citizen of the kingdom of heaven,
no indemnity is required. Once accomplished, results will last forever. Your re-creation is the one hope to
which you should aspire. (293-209, 1998/05/26)</p>
<ol>
<li>True Parents are the owners of true love. True Parents are the king and queen of love. We have lost
that most precious true love. The question is how we can recover it. True Parents, true love, true life and
true lineage form a realm that Satan cannot touch no matter how much he tries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Humanity must become tuned to God's Will for eternity. God and all people must constantly maintain an
eternal relationship as subject partner and object partners, with true love at the core. Unless we can arrive
at this goal, we cannot maintain a life centered on true love, which is God's ideal of creation. This is the
Principle. No one can deny it. This is why we absolutely need True Parents. (216-320, 1991/04/15)</p>
<ol>
<li>As a result of Adam's Fall, numerous walls were created. Now that True Parents have finally come,
they have removed the barriers with their love and paved the way to the realm of heart, both in the
heavenly world and on earth. Whether or not you tread that path is up to you, but the path is there. True
Parents have built a highway in every village. To get onto that highway, you must bring your own car and
find that road by exerting your own effort. Thanks to True Parents, the walls erected throughout human
history that blocked the realm of heart and that separated the spiritual and physical worlds are now broken
down. Just as water flows from a large main to every home, the road without any obstacles is now open to
everyone. On this foundation, the realm of unity between the spiritual world and the physical world can
finally be formed. (169-125, 1987/10/29)</li>
<li>Henceforth we must establish the standard in our own families based on the tradition of Adam and
Eve, the original husband and wife according to God's creation. We must perfect the realm of husband
and wife and become true parents. Then we must in turn bequeath true love, true life and true lineage to
our own true sons and daughters. This is the mission of all blessed families, and you must never forget it.
The reason we become true parents is not only to bring victory from the individual level to the levels of
the tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos; it is also to create the realm of God's liberation. (235-022,
1992/08/24)</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents come to deal with the fundamental problem of the family, and the Savior originally
comes to deal with the problems of the nation. True Parents have both these responsibilities. When they
engraft people with the seed of true love and true life, both of these matters can be resolved. Due to the
Fall, human beings received the seed of false love and false life. Since that made them false olive trees,
they must receive a graft from the true olive trees. Then they must connect to true love, so that by
centering on true love they may inherit life. Otherwise, they cannot belong to True Parents' bloodline.
(238-074, 1992/11/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All leaders want their successor or heir whom they raise to be better than themselves. This is the
principle of the creation of heaven and earth. Hence, you who are in the position of owners should open
the way for the son or daughter who most closely attends you to become even better than you are. Even
though Satan may close a door and cause your heir to fall away, still you must keep the door open for him
or her to return. Then your successor can inherit the original lineage, perfect and flawless, and be free of
the fallen lineage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you leaders believe this and put it into practice, then when I pass into the heavenly world as its
governor -- the True Parent, true teacher and true king in the position of having established a parent-child
relationship with God in lineage -- I will bequeath everything to you. I will consider you to be the
representatives of the family of True Parents that God established, and I will give you the position of my
representative as your inheritance. You need to believe that this proclamation is for heaven and earth.
Hence, you need to put it into practice. (574-188, 2007/09/04)</p>
<ol>
<li>You too must become true parents. If you become so, will you be true parents for a tribe or for a
people? Or even for a nation? If you reach the level of national-level true parents, you will ascend straight
to the heavenly kingdom.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many individual true parents. The best among them will be elevated to be the true parents of a
tribe. They can even be elevated to be the true parents of a people, a nation or the world. Nevertheless,
you cannot even begin unless you establish a true family.</p>
<p>Without a true family, you cannot go to the kingdom of heaven in the next world. It is a place that only
families can enter. The structure of the heavenly kingdom is based on gatherings of families. The formula
is based on gathering together. Thus, until you have your own family, you cannot enter the kingdom of
heaven. This is the way of thinking centered on True Parents. This is the way you must also walk as true
parents. (268-078, 1995/03/05)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We read in the Bible, "I am the way, and the truth and the life." But one thing is missing -- love.
Although it is written, "I am the way, and the truth and the life," what can we do with this? We need to
include love. What about, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life and the love. No one comes to the
Father except through me"? Jesus Christ is the central person of love. He was to become the True Parent.
It is just as the body takes after the mind: in the era of True Parents, if you resemble True Parents you
resemble God. (177-297, 1988/05/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you relate to God, the question is how to attain oneness with Him as the Parent in the realm of
heart. All beings, whether in the spiritual world or the physical world, whether our ancestors or those in
the angelic world, exist to safeguard and protect Him. This should be their first priority. They are meant
to feel in the core of their being that they are connected to God -- that their body with its four limbs exists
to connect to Him with a bond of true love. They are meant to have a relationship with their Lord
centering on true love. All creatures in our environment in this world and this universe are meant to exist
to become one with the Lord and to protect Him. Thus, when they perish, it should never be the case that
they feel a grievance over having been a victim.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then the question is how you connect to God in bonds of love, so you are one with Him from the core of
your being in your body to every thought in your mind. You need to be able to stand before Him with the
qualification to be a lord of creation, as God desired when He created you. Such lords or owners are the
sons and daughters who take after God in everything. (345-143, 2001/06/11)</p>
<ol>
<li>We have the idea we should become perfect. How can we attain such perfection? We need to follow a
formula, such as, "If you do this, you can build an ideal family." And indeed, there is a formula for
building an ideal tribe, nation, world and cosmos. The owner of this formula is God. So if you base your
life on this formula, you should have no problem taking root in perfection. We can reach perfection
through unity between God's large formula and our small formula. Then our individual foundation will
expand to become the foundation of the family, the tribe, the nation and the world, allowing us to stand
right next to God. And when we are with the Center, we can connect to the spirit world vertically. It
means we can become God's sons and daughters.</li>
</ol>
<p>To become God's children, we must resemble Him. God is united in mind and body. Yet your mind and
body are still struggling, even now. When are you going to unite them? If you are still on the way to
uniting them, it means you are not yet perfect. This is why I am telling you to humble yourself, live for
the sake of others, and devote yourself to fulfilling the Will.</p>
<p>If you have the conviction, "I am True Parents' representative; I am one with God. I am His champion,"
then you can stand in the central position. It means you are the second creator. Then you will have no
problem reaching perfection on the individual level. You will have no problem perfecting your family and
your tribe. Your influence can extend even beyond your nation. You can make connections with other
nations, transcending national borders. (248-185, 1993/08/03)</p>
