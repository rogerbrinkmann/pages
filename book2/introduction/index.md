# Book 2

## Introduction
Ever since the Fall of the first human ancestors Adam and Eve, God wanted to complete the
providence of salvation. He wanted to complete it through Jesus, whom He sent as the Messiah;
however, the people of Israel and the religion of Judaism failed to fulfill their responsibility to
receive him. Hence, God again sent a Savior to humankind, this time among the Korean people.
The True Parents have come with this mission.
Because the True Parents came to take charge of God's providence of salvation, their births were
events of great significance. Accordingly, many signs accompanied their births. For instance,
there was an old tree standing in front of True Father's birthplace. Shortly before he was born a
golden bird flew into that tree, sang beautifully, and then left. Also before the birth of True
Mother, Hong Soon-ae, True Mother's mother, received a message in a dream, "If you have a
son, he will become the king of the universe; if you have a daughter, she will become the queen of
the universe."
On April 17, 1935, at the age of 16 (by Korean counting), True Father was tearfully praying on a
mountainside when Jesus called him to complete the mission of the Messiah. After that, he went
through a preparation period: three years in his hometown, three years of study in Seoul, and
three years of study in Japan. Most especially during the time in Seoul, when he lived alone at a
rooming house, his life was one of strict self-discipline and self-cultivation as he pushed himself
in his studies and to develop his faith. Also, while he studied in Japan, he expanded his
experiences in various fields. In addition to his academic work, he immersed himself in activities
to support the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule and devoted himself to discovering the
truth of the Principle.
True Mother spent much of her childhood at the home of her maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo,
as well as with her mother, Hong Soon-ae. Both her mother and grandmother had dedicated
themselves to a life of faith in order to welcome the Lord at his Second Advent. After coming to
the South from the North, True Mother began studying at Hyochang Elementary School in Seoul.
She moved to Daegu, Seoguipo on Jeju Island, and to Chuncheon in Gangwon Province, all the
while continuing her schooling.
True Mother met True Father in 1956, when she was 13, soon after her graduation from
elementary school. Mother recalled what Father had told her about their first meeting, "Closing
my eyes, I spoke to God in a whisper, â€˜God, thank you for sending such an extraordinary woman
to this nation of Korea.'"
For a long time, God made preparations to send the Returning Lord and Heaven's Bride. Then,
through the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, True Father and True Mother emerged as the True
Parents of humankind.
