## Chapter 3 True Father's Childhood and Youth 

### Section 2 God's Call 

#### Family indemnity 
Before True Father was called by God, his family and relatives had to pay severe indemnity.
Until he reached the age of 16, his family was assaulted by all kinds of trials and tribulations.
For the sake of the providence sacrifices were their inevitable lot. They made the final sacrificial
condition to clear away Satan's accusation in order to secure the complete foundational point for
the victory on heaven's side. For three generations there were children who died away from
home, their whereabouts unknown. Notably, out of True Fathers 12 siblings, the five brothers and
sisters for whom he cared the most died at very young ages. In this way heaven completely
severed him from relationships that he could depend on, and from the people he most loved. This
was so he would no longer be attached to worldly things. After his call as well, True Father had
to live every day of his life without any relationships with people in whom he could find shelter,
or to whom he would pay special attention. This is how he lived, wherever he was in the world.
1. The Unification Church is walking the path for the Will. In order to inherit this Will, all members must
go through a course of indemnification. I began this course when I was 16 years old. By that time, five of
my parents' 13 children had died and only eight remained alive. Not only did people die, but also much
livestock -- dogs, cows and horses. Evil spirits stirred themselves. You may not be familiar with such
things. Truly, many strange phenomena occurred that were difficult to understand. They were
undoubtedly the cunning schemes of the devil to destroy my family. However I am telling you they really
happened.
Before I rise up triumphantly representing all nations of the world, I need to set up a condition that Satan
cannot accuse. In the course of my battle against Satan, he attacked my family. That was the price we had
to pay. Likewise, I also need to present a condition upon which I can stand proudly before history, by
claiming the right of victory over Satan as the representative of all peoples and nations of the world. The
same condition applies to Unification Church members; the same condition is required to found a unified
nation. (214-215, 1991/02/02)
2. Spiritual phenomena do not happen only in the invisible world. They manifest in various forms and
ways in the visible world as well. Satan plotted and mobilized every means to bring my family to ruin.
One thing he did was drive my older brother and older sister insane, and this caused much havoc. When I
was young I witnessed such spiritual phenomena and problems that arose from the spirit world acting
behind the scenes. One day I saw that my older brother, whom I thought had gone mad, was talking. He
seemed to be murmuring to himself, but when I listened to him carefully, I recognized that the substance
of his words was formidable. Also, the way he spoke changed depending on the situation. Apparently, a
number of spirits would come and talk with him all day long. I could see immediately that this was
happening. (227-116, 1992/02/11)
3. All of my friends who were closest and dearest to me, the ones who most deserved heaven's blessing,
were taken away. Anyone whom I could trust and count on was completely cut off from my life. Some of
them were from North Pyeongan Province and some were from Hwanghae Province. They were my best
friends, but they were all taken away. Then my younger sister, the closest in age to me and whom I
adored the most, was taken away. My parents had many daughters, while my aunt's family did not have
any. At the sincere request of my aunt, my sister was sent to my aunt's home and lived there. So I always
prayed a lot for her. She absolutely obeyed me, her immediate older brother. I thought I would do
anything to make her happy, but even that desire was cruelly crushed. Not only my little sister but also
my beloved little brother were taken away. We can learn from this that there is no mercy in the course of
indemnity. Still, I had to go through this course. (029-210, 1970/02)
4. My closest friends were all taken by the spirit world. Come to think of it now, the reason the spirit
world took all of them away was to prevent me from sharing my situation with them and developing
personal relationships with them. Had I done so, it would have hindered my carrying out the Will of God.
Thus, God took away all the people whom I cared about in the world. Knowing this very well, I could not
take any other path. I am not doing what I am doing because I am a fool. Wouldn't I have thought about
this over and over? (022-124, 1969/02/02) 

#### God's call through Jesus 
Around the time True Father joined the Presbyterian Church, and while he was receiving a
modern education, his thinking grew wider and deeper. He began asking serious questions about
the present and future realities. Even as he faced many incomprehensible calamities in his own
family and clan, he witnessed the innumerable tragedies of his people under Japanese rule, and
personally experienced Korea's pain and sorrow as a weak nation. At the same time, Father
struggled to find the solution to the fundamental questions of human life.
Father turned 16 (by Korean counting) shortly after he transferred to Jeongju Primary School.
Then, during Easter week, on April 17, 1935, while he was tearfully praying in the mountains at
dawn, he met Jesus, who shared with him many profound and amazing truths. The two of them
had more discussions over the following days. After True Father accepted his call from God, he
continued studying in his hometown, in Seoul, and abroad in Tokyo. During that time he went
through a period of preparation to deepen his faith and cultivate his sense of mission for his
future role as a providential figure. 
5. My encounter with Jesus in the year I turned 16 was a profound spiritual experience. It was the first of
many revelations. After that special encounter, I have continued conversing with the living God and with
Jesus even until today. I also had conversations with the saints and sages in the spirit world. I cannot
describe in words all the things we shared. God chose me in accordance with His providential timetable.
(087-285, 1976)
6. I was 16 years old when I had my first experience of actually knowing God. Before then I was merely
in the position of a humble seeker of truth. Ever since I entered boyhood I had been contemplating the
fundamental questions of human life: Who am I? Where did I come from? What is the purpose of life?
Will our life continue after we die? Does God really exist? Is God omnipotent or is He powerless? If God
is truly omnipotent, why does He not solve the problems of humanity? Why is there so much suffering on
this earth?
For nine years following that first experience, I lived together with the omnipotent God and with Jesus. I
visited the spirit world on numerous occasions. Little by little, God revealed amazing truths to me. It felt
as if the morning sun was rising after a long night of darkness. In that truth I could see the dawning light
of a new, glorious culture. These special revelations, based on the New Testament, are higher than any
previous religious teachings. I felt that they had the power and ability to embrace all religions and unite
them. The revelations that I received are the core of what is now called the Principle. God has
commanded me to spread this Principle to the ends of the earth. (102-288, 1979/01)
7. I cannot describe the seriousness of the position in which I stood when I was 16 years old. It was the
most difficult time for God, for Jesus, and for the churches that God had specially prepared for the Second
Coming. Korea was under the rule of Japan, and those churches were driven into a corner with nowhere to
run. At that moment God, heaven and earth, the five founders of the world's great religions and the
religious sphere all joined together around one point: the position of the Lord at the Second Advent. They
called me to take responsibility for that position, and I accepted the call. Once I accepted that position, my
own family and my country of Korea were also placed in a serious position. Hence I could not sleep at
night. I tried to eat, but I could not swallow. I could see everything clearly. Heaven and earth were about
to collapse, and the responsibility to save them was on my shoulders. Imagine how serious I had to be!
(554-257, 2007/02/04)
8. The new revelations that I received explained God's Will very clearly. That Will is aimed at bringing
salvation to this world. The Unification Church is not just another denomination. The Unification Church
is leading the movement for the salvation of the world. Those who join this movement study God's Word,
by which they clearly understand the concept of a God-centered individual, a God-centered family, a
God-centered nation and a God-centered world. (087-285, 1976)
9. Adam and Eve fell when they were 16 years old. God was only able to raise them until the age of 16,
relating with them by a bond based on their inner heart and original nature. In my case, God chose me at
the age of 16 years and specially raised me so that I would be able to begin uniting the spiritual world and
the physical world that had been separated as a result of the Fall. Ever since the age of 16, I have grown
up connecting to God's original heart. That is why Satan and his world must follow me. Satan, who has
been ruling human beings from the positions of older son, father and grandfather, also governs from the
position of the nation, which rules over the realm of religion. Such is Satan's sovereignty. In human
history to this day there has never been a time when this order could be reversed. Nations always have
been in the front, leading religions. In other words, nations have been dragging religions around.
However, I am now reversing this order. I have been engrafted to the work of God ever since I was 16
years old, when I began to discover the secrets of heaven, of Satan and of human history. (493-229,
2005/04/25)
10. Time after time I came up against dark obstacles. Whenever that happened, I remembered God's voice
when He told me, "I am alive." You would not know that His voice remains in the marrow of my bones to
this day. I have not forgotten God's sorrowful situation, which He shared with me when He called me. I
cannot forget God's plea to me, "You need to focus only on your relationship with Me; you must not
forsake Me." Sometimes I feel sorry for my own situation, but then I remember that God's situation is
more sorrowful than mine. So, although you should feel indignation over history, you must experience
even more the aching heart of our Father, who has been enduring unbearable sorrow. Don't you think you
need to do that? You must, and then you can actually become His filial sons and daughters. Afterward
you should stand up and boldly proclaim, "Father, because I understood Your heart, I have become a
better son or daughter than any filial son or daughter in the world."
I have fought for this, and I will continue doing so. I urge you to do the same. Then, from now on, it will
not matter if this or that religious body opposes the Unification Church and makes false accusations
against me. No matter how much they try to suppress me and the church with all their power and
authority, they will not be able to destroy the foundation we have established. (028-296, 1970/02/11)
