## Chapter 3 True Father's Childhood and Youth 

### Section 1 Love for Nature 

#### Lessons from nature 
True Father spent about 18 years of his life within about ten kilometers of his birthplace. That
area was the stage of his activities until he graduated from primary school. This was an
important time in his life, when he learned about nature and had many realizations from
observing and experiencing it. As he studied nature, he showed unusual interest, inquisitiveness
and passion for learning. Numerous experiences with the world of nature and his agricultural
surroundings nurtured his emotional sensitivity and depth. As he observed the love of birds and
insects for their young, he verified the principles of human love. All things in nature became his
friends, and they also became his textbooks of heart and love.
1. As we grow up, our hometown provides us with abundant opportunities for learning and emotional
growth. Just by looking at the mountains, we realize that they are enveloped by a huge net of heart -- it is
unforgettable. It is the same for a creek with the variety of fish and insects that live there. We can grow
when we utilize all of the creation as our basic textbooks, from which we can learn and gain knowledge
that we never forget. We can learn from all the animals and plants in the mountains and indeed every
single thing in the natural world. What we find in our hometown provides us with abundant materials to
help us learn and grow internally in heart and feeling. That is why we miss the mountains, fields and
rivers of our hometown. (187-294, 1989/02/12)
2. When I was a child, I went everywhere in my village, the neighboring villages, the mountains and over
the mountains, with the thought to go and see everything throughout the land. That is how I was in my
childhood. I went to a reservoir and caught the different kinds of fish that lived there. I caught all kinds of
birds. I caught all kinds of insects. There was nothing there that I did not catch. That is how I became
knowledgeable about the things around me. I knew where the crabs lived, where the different species of
fish lived, what animals lived where, and so on. Having discovered and investigated all their dens and
nests, I knew very well what creatures lived in each place. That is why I knew the best fishing spots.
(271-259, 1995/08/28)
3. I did not spend much time in the fields. Every day I roamed throughout the mountains. In the
mountains there are all kinds of flowers, all kinds of birds and all kinds of wild animals. Everything is
there; it is like a natural museum. Human beings have learned how to make many things by imitating
nature. We have to love nature. On the night of a full moon, I never wanted to stay home and sleep. There
is something mystical about the night of a full moon. On such nights I would go into the pine forest deep
in the mountains and sleep where the wolves and tigers lived. I would lie down on a bed of pine needles
underneath a huge pine tree, where weeds do not grow and where you do not get wet even when it rains.
You cannot imagine what a marvelous feeling it was to sleep there. When you go to such a place and see
the bright moon, even the blowing breeze will sound mystical to you. And when a tall tree shakes in the
wind, it will reflect all kinds of colors, and you will be entranced by them. Mysteriously, the trees jostling
with each other will sound like people talking together. The Principle can be found in the natural
environment rather than in other places. (562-165, 2007/05/06)
4. I truly love nature. I used to go to the mountains and just enjoy nature while sitting on the grass.
Sometimes I would fall asleep leaning against a large tree with nature all around. I picked wild vegetables
and ate them. These were unforgettable experiences. I believe that nature provided me with the
fundamental materials that facilitated my emotional growth. When I observed the trees in the mountains
and by the streams, although they were all trees, no two looked the same. That made a deep impression on
me. Nature is a museum containing all kinds of materials that each of us can find memorable. (187-295,
1989/02/12)
5. I knew all the migrating birds that came to my village. Once I saw a flock of migrating birds that I had
never seen before. They were so colorful and beautiful. I wondered where these birds would hatch their
eggs, since they had migrated away and returned after having their young. I also wondered why they
came to my neighborhood. I thought it had to be one of two reasons, either for water or to nest. Birds
drink water, but they want good water. So I looked for a good source of water and found a spring. I
thought to myself that they would come there for water. So I went to that spring every day and waited for
the birds to come. I waited for about two weeks. Then, indeed, they came! Birds are truly fascinating
creatures. (180-245, 1988/08/22)
6. There was a brook in my hometown. I caught many kinds of freshwater fish that were living there,
including mudfish and eels. I thought, if I had a large pond at my house I would bring them home and put
them in it. These days it is relatively easy for people to have a pond at home and to raise fish. How
wonderful it would have been if I could have done that! We simply could not do it back then. But, still
young and not knowing any better, I simply dug a water hole and put some small fish in it. I thought that
fish could live in any kind of water. But, after keeping them there overnight, the next morning I
discovered they had all died. Without knowing that they needed certain conditions in order to live, I sadly
said, "I invested all of my sincerity so you could live; why did you die?" Looking at those dead fish, I
said, "Oh, your mom will cry over your death. I will cry for you too." There, alone, I cried for the fish.
From this, you can tell that I am a caring person. (187-294, 1989/02/12)
7. I was a champion at catching eels. The sea was about eight kilometers from my home, and I could
travel there and back faster than most people. When I was young, my nickname was Tiny Eyes. Rumors
spread, "Tiny Eyes catches dozens of eels every day and steams them; then he even feeds them to the pigs
and cows." Villagers who heard the rumors came to my house and talked about eels. Then, after telling
my mother to prepare to cook eels, I would run out to catch them. By mealtime I was back with the eels I
had caught, and my mother would serve them to the visitors either stewed or steamed, whichever way
they preferred. They could eat as much as they desired, enjoying eel to their hearts' content. (615-148,
2009/08/22)
8. All of the creation exists for the sake of human beings. Therefore, once we possess the qualifications to
be its owner, with the ability to truly love even the tiniest living things, we will not feel ashamed but
stand with dignity to receive the love of God. That is why puppies want to receive love from us; sparrows
and even spiders want the same. All creatures want to receive love from human beings. In the old days, I
was a champion at catching birds. There was no kind of bird in my neighborhood that I did not catch.
When migratory birds came into my area, I even caught them; I would not go to sleep until I had caught
them. This is how I was when I was a little boy. When I grew older, I dug a birdbath for the birds and left
food for them. After I had invested my loving heart in digging the birdbath, they came and drank. I
brought food for them and sprinkled it on the ground; then they would not fly away when they saw me
coming. When birds come to understand that you will not harm them, they will surely like you. That is
because human beings are their lords. (173-027, 1988/02/01)
9. When spring comes every animal goes about searching for its mate. Birds do that, and so do insects.
When the season turns to summer, try listening to the sounds of insects. There are exactly two kinds. One
is the sound of crying from hunger. The other is the sound of singing, looking for a mate. The signals are
simple. One is signaling to its friends, "I am hungry; let's go together and eat." The other signals, "Come
with me; I am a good mate for you." These are the two kinds of signals they make. Living in the
countryside, there were many insects for me to catch. Also, I caught many different kinds of animals:
lynx, raccoon and rabbits. It was fun and very exciting. I thought that they were living alone, but in fact
each had its own mate. All were in pairs. It is the same with the insect world and the world of birds. (140-
296, 1986/02/14)
10. I love the Korean white pine tree because it bears fruit -- pine nuts -- that we can eat. However, these
pine nuts cannot be shelled easily. You must use a stone to smash the shell. Even if you know what to do,
your aim must be precise; otherwise, the shell will not open. That is why I say that not just anyone can
shell them. Another thing about the white pine: when you plant it, it only germinates when the ground is
frozen. Hence, its planting time is opposite that of other plants. Because it must freeze, you should not
plant it in spring, but in the autumn.
Nothing can change the nature of a Korean white pine. It is not influenced by the conditions of its
environment; on the contrary, it carries an attribute that causes it to burst out even if it finds itself in the
most severe environment. Then with the arrival of spring, its seeds will sprout and grow into Korean
white pine trees. That is the nature of a Korean white pine. The tree has five needles in each cluster: one
representing the center and the others representing the east, west, north and south. That is why I love the
Korean white pine tree. Also, this tree grows very well. It grows straight up. It sends its root straight
down, and its trunk grows straight up. (178-119, 1988/06/01) 

#### Training in self-sufficiency
In his childhood, True Father experienced all the tasks of farming, including plowing rice
paddies, plowing fields, planting rice and weeding rice. He learned through experience the
secrets for successfully growing rice, beans, corn, sweet potatoes and other crops. He did not
mind spreading manure and raking leaves. He eagerly took part in every kind of work and
learned to do the best job he could in whatever he was doing. He also learned how to mend his
clothes and knit his own socks, hats and gloves. In this way, he trained himself to live alone,
without needing to depend on others.
11. As soon as I came back from school, I would take off my school shirt and jump into farm work. I was
always on the job ahead of my siblings, even my older brother and older sisters. I thought, "Unless I earn
the title of champion farmer, I cannot become the leader of the farmers' world." So I taught myself how to
become the best farmer. I became an expert on where to plant regular beans and where to plant red beans.
I learned how to tell what crop would be best for the soil by looking at the ground. Without hesitation I
would say, "Sweet potatoes should flourish here. Why did you plant something else?" Others responded,
"How do you know that?" I learned it all through experience. Hence, when I go to a rural community, I
am a farmer's farmer. It is the same when I go to a fishing village. I invented an unsinkable boat, and I
developed a unique and effective system for catching tuna. (220-333, 1991/10/20)
12. I knitted my own socks and made my own clothes. When the weather got cold, I made a hat and wore
it. I am the one who taught knitting to my older sisters. In order to fulfill your mission for the Will, you
must train yourself to be self-sufficient. When I needed underwear, I got a roll of cloth, cut it to a pattern
and made some. When I put them on, they fit perfectly. I even made Korean socks for my mother. She
said, "I thought you were making them for fun, but they fit me so well!" You should be able to do all
these kinds of things based on your own study. You should know how to make your own clothes, socks
and hats. If you can do that, even if you live alone you will be able to accomplish your responsibility for
the Will. (222-271, 1991/11/03)
13. These days, there is one kind of food that I miss. I have tried all the famous dishes in the world. Is
there a food anywhere that I have not tasted? Yet, I still miss this one food. In the olden days in the
countryside, farmers had to pass through a period called the "May potato challenge." Having used up all
our grains through the winter, in the month of May we had only potatoes to eat. Then finally the spring
barley harvest arrived, after which we had barley to cook and eat. The barley that I am talking about is not
the pearl barley that you buy at the store, but uncracked barley. The grains have to be soaked in water for
some time before cooking them. When we put them in our bowls, if we pressed them down firmly with a
spoon, individual grains would break loose and fly out of the bowl. I remember eating it mixed with
Korean hot pepper paste. This is the dish that I miss even now. It is not tasty if you mix it with anything
else; it must be hot pepper paste. Whenever I put a spoonful of that reddish barley into my mouth, the
grains would constantly come out through my teeth. I closed my lips tightly in order to eat it. I had to take
time because it was so difficult to chew. I miss those olden days. (212-180, 1991/01/06)
14. Living in the country, you can have a lot of fun and many wonderful experiences. That is where I
learned everything I needed and collected all the necessary information to prepare myself to build the
monumental house of God's Will for the future. The many experiences I had doing things in nature were
how I taught myself to be an expert in whatever I did. When I go to a rural area I can become a farmer,
and when I go to the sea I can become a fisherman. When I went out net fishing, I left home early in the
morning and totally invested myself with the conviction that I would set a new record. I went out with the
cry of the rooster at the crack of dawn and did not return home from my labors until the stars came out.
All my life, my personal motto has always been to do my very best to set a new world record. That is why
wherever I go, whatever I do, I think that I will never be defeated by anyone. And actually, I am never
defeated. I also keep this standard when it comes to making conditions of devotion. (050-303,
1971/11/08) 

#### Training of heart 
In his childhood, True Father shed many tears. He was an extremely deep-hearted and
compassionate boy. When he was raising birds or fish at home, if one of them died he was drawn
by compassion to shed tears for it, thinking of its mother who would grieve for her young. He
defended his friends when they were bullied by stronger boys. Whenever he heard that someone
was going hungry or starving, he would take rice from the rice jar at home and bring it to him or
her, without letting his parents know. When he happened upon a mother who had just given birth
but had no food to eat, he brought her rice and the seaweed to make the soup that Korean women
eat after having a baby. When his friends' parents could not afford to buy them the new clothes
that were customarily prepared for children on traditional holidays, he gave them his own new
clothes. These are some of the ways he expressed his deep heart for whoever was suffering
hardship.
15. I became mature enough to feel compassion for others shortly after I turned seven, the age when I
started going to the village school. I used to figure out when the pregnant women in the village were
about to give birth by looking at the size of their bellies. One day I found out that one of the women who
was pregnant had no rice at home. So, one month before she had the baby I gave her rice and seaweed for
the seaweed soup all mothers have after delivery. This is why the poor people of my village confided in
me all of their secrets.
I felt responsible to care for people who were having difficulties, whatever their situation. Every year in
the autumn I would pick chestnuts for them. I would save some of the stock of corn at my house and
bring it to their homes. It is the only way I could feel at peace. It is from this kind of background that I
have a foundation even to think of feeding all the people of the world. (431-107, 2004/01/12)
16. When I was young, my family was quite well off. When my friends who were poor came to school
with cooked millet or barley in their lunch boxes, I traded my lunch box with them. I could not just eat
my own well-prepared food with rice while watching them eat such meager food. If my friend's mother or
father was sick but had no money to see a doctor, I would go to my mother and father and tearfully ask
them for money, explaining my friend's situation. When I was about 11 years old, I told my father that I
was going to sell rice to help someone out. But even before he approved, I helped myself to as much rice
as I could and scooped it into a bag. I was in such a hurry that I did not even tie the mouth of the bag.
Then I carried it over my shoulder and walked some eight kilometers to the market to sell it. I should have
tied up the bag with a string. But since I did not, I had to hold on tight to keep the rice from spilling. I
walked as fast as I could, fearing that my father would come after me. You have no idea how much my
heart pounded and how hard I gasped for air. I cannot forget it to this day; I do not think I will forget it for
the rest of my life. All those experiences enabled me to stand in the position to take the path for the Will.
(058-082, 1972/06/06)
17. My nature is such that whenever I saw a shivering beggar passing by my house during the winter, I
could not eat or sleep. So I would ask my mother and father to bring the beggar in to our main room and
feed him well before sending him off. Don't you think that this is a basis to be loved by heaven?
Whenever I heard through the grapevine that someone in my neighborhood was starving, I could not fall
asleep at night wondering how I could help him. I would scoop rice out of my family's rice jar and give it
to the hungry person without letting my parents know. (056-035, 1972/05/10)
18. I like rice cakes; so I used to ask my mother, "Please make some rice cakes." But she was always too
busy farming, weaving or making clothes in preparation for the marriage of her children. My mother
indeed had no time to rest. But I kept asking her to make me rice cakes, and finally she would make some
simple ones, such as red bean rice cakes or steamed rice cakes. She made them in a large earthenware
steamer. But they would not last even three days because I would share them. That is how I was.
Whenever I had some concern for my village, I could not fall asleep. I realize that heaven has been
guiding me since childhood to have such a caring heart. That is why whenever I saw someone in my
village who was poor, I wanted to help that person in any way I could. When there was a problem in the
village, I did everything possible to resolve it. I believed that this was my job, not someone else's.
Without having this core nature within me, I could not be who I am today. It had to be my inborn nature.
There is a Korean maxim, "The water at the surface must be clear for the water at the bottom to be clear."
The "top water" is the leader who sets the example. Human beings are spiritual. So, when we have the
quality of pure water, others will want to come and live together with us. They will lean on us for support.
(056-035, 1972/05/10)
19. When I was young we had a bee farm with hundreds of hives full of bees. When you do bee farming,
you have to set up honeycomb frames; then the bees make their homes there and when they make their
honey they save it there. Honeycomb frames were expensive. Normally the frames with their empty
honeycombs were stacked and stored on a cabinet, but I found them and mashed the waxen honeycombs
together to make candles. Many people in the country had no light at night because they could not afford
to buy kerosene. So I gave them the candles that I made, thinking that since I could not give them
kerosene, at least I should give them candles. I had to do it because otherwise I felt so uneasy; I could not
bear doing nothing for them. That is why I mashed all the honeycombs together to make candles and
distributed them to each house. At that time I was just a child, so I had no idea how expensive they were!
After finding out what I did, my father scolded me severely. Yet I never admitted that I had done anything
wrong; how can it be wrong to help those in need? So after scolding me for some time, my father just
gave up and stopped. (163-159, 1987/05/01)
20. A disabled couple lived in my village. The husband was blind, and his wife was crippled. Even so,
this couple was regarded in the village as an exemplary couple. Though the wife limped while leaning on
her cane, she always guided her husband everywhere he needed to go. Her mouth was crooked and she
had all sorts of physical problems, but her husband loved her very much, more than he would love a
beauty queen. They had no place to live, so when the winter came they would stay in my family's mill.
They had only a straw mat, so I would bring them my pad and my quilt. For that reason, they liked me
very much. One day I heard they had passed away. I was so sad; I remember crying over their deaths.
(420-211, 2003/10/11)
21. Like you, I too had a lively youth overflowing with hope. But even before I knew the Will, I wanted
to become a friend to those in pain and suffering. I was greatly interested in people who were not doing
well. I did not try to become close to the children of well-to-do and influential families. Most people did
that, but I did the opposite. If I knew there was a poor person in the village who had nothing to eat, I
could not sleep. I had to do everything I could to solve the situation. In this way, I wanted to follow a path
to become friends, even close friends, with everyone. (117-018, 1982/01/30) 

#### Gifts of the Spirit 
From childhood, True Fathers personality was such that whenever he took a path, he would
follow it to the end. His tenacious spirit helped him to succeed in whatever he did. Once he
decided that something was the right thing to do, he acted on it immediately. Thus, during his
childhood he cultivated the abilities and character traits he would need to fulfill God's
providence of salvation as the True Parent. Furthermore, even as a child he surprised people
around him with his predictions regarding people's illnesses or problems that would occur in the
future. This was one special ability he had.
22. My mother, my father and everyone in the village counted on me. I was known as the fearfully sharp
and smart one in the Moon clan. I could do anything. Wrestling, boxing or any other sport -- I excelled at
them all. I was always one of the top three students in my class in school. As soon as I determined to
become the number one student and not just one of the top three, I achieved it. Why? I would study twice,
even three times harder than the number one student. That is the kind of person I am. That is why, when I
probed into the fundamental issues of life and religion, I could root out what had been unknown and
reveal it to the world. My personality is such that once I set my mind to do something, I forget to eat or
sleep until I finish it. That is the most necessary quality for the work of restoration through indemnity.
(319-112, 2000/03/17)
23. As a child, once I started crying for some reason, I did not stop even after an hour; I cried about it all
day long. Hence, I was given the nickname "All-day Crier." Not only that, when I cried I did not cry
quietly; I cried at the top of my lungs so that the whole village heard me crying. I wanted every elder in
the village to come and see what was going on. I cried so hard that I would wake people from their sleep.
I cried and cried as if something terrible had gone wrong. In the end, my throat would swell up and I
could not make any more sounds. Also, when I cried I did not just sit still. I jumped up and down and
bumped into things, so that I would cut myself here and there and be covered with blood. This should be
enough for you to understand my personality. Reflecting on this, God is truly wise. He made me such that
once I start something, I never let go of it. (050-297, 1971/11/08)
24. I was a strong and healthy youth with an active and passionate personality. The scope of my activities
was three times greater than that of ordinary people. When it snowed I did not sleep, but instead I went
out at night hunting for weasels. Following their tracks in the snow I would walk and walk, even
forgetting that I was getting hungry. I gave my mother such a hard time. Definitely I was an unusual boy
with indomitable tenacity. When I was in my teens I already had my father and mother on a string. With
one wrong move my father and mother would find themselves trapped; then they had no choice but to
surrender to me. I am doing what I am doing today only because I was capable of such things from an
early age. My parents sometimes scolded me, but I would never give in, no matter what. All they asked of
me was to admit that I did wrong, but I refused. Since I truly believed I had done nothing wrong, why
would I admit to it? (136-132, 1985/12/22)
25. No one in the world can match the tenacity of my character. In my childhood I fought a boy who was
stronger than me, and he beat me. From that moment on for three to four months, I could not sleep in
peace until I finally bested him. That is how tenacious I am. People could say I am a person who is to be
greatly feared, because I absolutely despise losing. I never let anything defeat me. When I do something, I
strive for victory; the thought of defeat never crosses my mind. I already know that win or lose, once I
start something I will keep striving until I achieve victory; otherwise I will die. That is the kind of
personality I have. (056-284, 1972/05/18)
26. I have a very quick-tempered personality. I cannot ignore even a single swear word directed at me. If
someone hits me even once I cannot stand idle. I also detest losing to anyone. I have all these extreme
aspects in my character. However, because of such traits I excel at many things. I determine to win at any
sport I play. My brain is not bad, either. Imagine then, how I, with this kind of personality, had to endure
and swallow things that were simply unbearable. Many times, even hundreds of times, I had to accept
situations that could not have been more humiliating. But I overcame them all. It is because God took a
similar path. God must also have this same kind of fiery character; and, beyond that, He is capable of
wiping out the whole world. But this world still remains because God holds back His anger and endures
all manner of difficulties. (065-328, 1973/03/04)
27. When I was young, I never lost a wrestling match against anyone else in my age group. However, I
once lost a wrestling match to a boy in my village three years older than me. So I looked for a way to beat
him. Spring arrived. Anyone who has lived in a rural area knows that in springtime when acacia trees
have absorbed plenty of moisture, their bark can be peeled off like white pine bark. So I went to an acacia
tree and bent its trunk back and forth until its bark started peeling, and stripped it off all the way down. Its
bark is tough. Then, I continually wrestled with that bare acacia tree-trunk. I wrestled it while telling
myself, "I'll never rest until I beat you!" Six months after he beat me, I finally beat that boy; I sat on top
of him on the ground. I focused on nothing else, forgetting to eat or sleep, until I could achieve that. (139-
052, 1986/01/26)
28. Ever since I was eight years old, I was able to match people by looking at their pictures. I matched
many couples from all over the village, including my own older sister and some of my more distant
relatives. Also, I could see the future. When I said, "It is going to rain," it would rain without fail. When I
said that a certain person in this town would die within a week, it in fact would happen. There were many
instances like that. So people came to me with a picture of a person whom they were considering for
marriage. They would ask me, "Look at this picture. Do you think this person is a good match or a bad
one?" I would answer at one glance. If I said "Bad" but, nevertheless, they went ahead with it, it turned
out to be bad. If I said "Good," it actually turned out to be a good marriage. I was that accurate, even
though I did not look at the picture for very long. This is the kind of record I have. (113-236, 1981/05/08)
29. In my village I was known as the tiny-eyed boy from that Osan house. Everyone knew me by that
nickname because my eyes were so small. I was told that after my mother gave birth to me, she examined
my face for a long time, thinking I might be missing my eyes. Only when I blinked did she finally feel
relieved. I needed such eyes. It is because I was born with eyes that can see objects in the far distance that
I came to a complete understanding of not only this world, but even the heart and situation of God. The
whole world will follow after me once they discover the true value of this. If they lined up across the
world, the line of people who would want to come and see me would extend across the Korea Strait, all
the way to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. (204-089, 1990/07/01)
30. I also had an eye for cows. I was able to tell at a glance whether or not a cow was worth buying.
Whenever I said, "That cow is not a good cow to buy," my father did not buy it. Good cows have a
handsome neckline, forelegs and hind legs and a good waistline. A good cow must meet these four
conditions. In my boyhood, when I went to the cattle market with my father, I inspected the cows for him.
When I told my father things about cows that he was not so knowledgeable about, he asked me, "How do
you know all that?" In fact, I was born with this knowledge. That is why today I am able to do things that
no one else in this world is capable of doing. (120-138, 1982/10/05)
31. I have always been a good judge of character. When I looked at someone on the street and got the
feeling, "He must be such-and-such a person," I would follow him around to see if my intuition was
correct. I would ask him, "You did so and so, right?" It was not something that the spirit world taught me;
I just felt it in my heart. So I confronted him, "You did so and so, right?" He would be surprised and say,
"How did you know?" My reading of that person was accurate. Even sitting in my room, I could
immediately tell who was in the next room, whether that person was doing something good or bad, and
whether he was living as a good person or a bad person. (040-298, 1971/02/07)
