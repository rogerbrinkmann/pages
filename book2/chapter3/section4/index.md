## Chapter 3 True Father's Childhood and Youth 

### Section 4 Study in Japan

#### First days in Japan
To broaden and deepen himself in preparation for his mission, True Father went to study in
Japan. On March 31, 1941, he departed from Seoul Station and took the Hikari line train to
Busan. On April 1, he sailed to Japan on the Shokei Maru, a liner operating between the port of
Busan and Shimonoseki. At the beginning of April, Father enrolled in the Waseda Technical High
School, which was attached to Waseda University, and began his studies in electrical
engineering.
1. From childhood I held the thought, "If my country (Korea) were stronger than Japan, its fate would
have been different." This was its problem. I felt deeply that my country's weakness, especially the
weakness of its external foundation, was the reason it could not avoid a miserable fate. Studying the
countries of the world, I learned that the most powerful country in the world at the time was the United
States. As a child I already knew that. I further thought, "The United States is a much larger and more
powerful country than Japan, but it's just the same there. Doesn't it also try to take advantage of weak
nations for its own benefit? Is there any righteous country anywhere which, as the representative nation of
the world, protects and lifts up weak countries? If there were such a country, what would it look like?"
As a child, I thought that what had been historically impossible for human beings would be possible for
the Creator. I thought that if He truly existed, He could do it. Therefore I resolved, "If the Creator, the
Absolute Being, exists, I will partner with Him to do the work of saving my country and liberating its
oppressed people." But first I needed an answer regarding the existence of God. For this I searched within
religions. I thought that if God really exists, then I must find a way to meet Him. As I was passing
through my teens and approaching my twenties, I agonized over many issues on my journey of faith. I
thought, "I have to go to Japan and then to the United States. I need to experience sorrow and persecution
there as a representative of a people whose power is smaller and weaker." (199-213, 1990/02/17)
2. As I began my journey to Japan and was crossing the Han River Bridge, I shed many tears. I felt as if I
were leaving the Korean people behind, like orphans. It seems it was only the day before yesterday when
those tears poured down my face. On the train to Busan I wept bitterly all the way while covering my
head with my coat. A Japanese woman saw me crying and said, "Young man, did your father or mother
die? Everyone goes through that kind of sorrow." She tried to comfort me, but my sorrow was something
that sprang from a heart completely filled with love for my country. I tell you, people who cannot love
their country cannot truly love heaven. (039-062, 1971/01/09)
3. On my way to Japan I traveled from Seoul to Busan on the Hikari line train. While riding that train I
asked myself, "What is it that I should learn in Japan?" Then I resolved, "I will liberate my country, and I
will pave the way for the next generation to have hope and to prosper in an independent nation." I still
remember shedding tears as I held on to a handrail while crossing the Han River. At that moment I
resolved, "By the time I return, I will no longer be shedding tears." (199-185, 1990/02/16)
4. In Busan I boarded a ship bound for Japan. I still remember vividly how I continuously shed tears on
the way. As Korea was under Japanese rule, I thought, "Who will liberate this poor nation from its
shackles?" I gazed at the stars throughout the night and longed for the day of my country's and my
people's liberation. I tearfully prayed to God, "Now I am departing my country. Oh God! Please protect
my country until I return." That time is still fresh in my memory, as if it happened yesterday. (039-062,
1971/01/09)
5. I attended evening classes at the technical school at Waseda University so that during the daytime I
could work as a laborer to help other Korean students pay their tuition. You do not know all the
difficulties I went through in Japan. Japanese people who are now alive must appeal with tears for their
nation to be forgiven. Otherwise Japan cannot stand. Japanese people need to apologize for the shameful
way they treated Korea and the other nations of Asia. (590-145, 2008/05/20)
6. I had many Japanese friends when I was living in Japan. I treated them with utmost respect. Whenever
they were in difficult situations, they came to see me to discuss their problems. Sometimes they asked out
of concern, "How is Korea doing?" I did not want to be outdone by any of my Japanese friends. So when
they spoke one word, I spoke two words. I generally speak very fast, but when I spoke with Japanese
people I spoke even faster. I studied how to speak fast and trained myself to do so. I resolved I would
someday lead Japanese youth and mobilize them for the sake of the world. So I practiced to gain the
ability to discuss issues better than Japanese people could, by gaining deeper and broader knowledge in
all fields. (205-069, 1990/07/07)
7. In my childhood I used to speak slowly. However, after coming to Japan, as I was learning to speak
better Japanese every day, I competed with Japanese people to see who could say more in one minute. If I
was ever defeated I could not fall asleep, so I trained myself to speak even more rapidly. If in 30 minutes
I could say 1,000 words speaking normally, by speaking faster I could say more than 2,000 words. When
learning a language it is important to train yourself through practice. (055-056, 1972/04/23) 

#### Mind-body discipline
During the time he studied in Japan, True Father immersed himself in the task of researching and
systematizing the Principle. He repeatedly pored over the Bible and compared it with the
Principle that he had newly discovered, in order to verify it with the Scripture. Bibles in Korean,
Japanese and English were always on his desk at the boarding house. The Korean and Japanese
Bibles, especially, were so full of underlining in different colors that people could barely read the
words on the pages. The process of finding and systematizing the vast and fundamental truth was
a lonely path; there was no one to guide him through it.
Besides his academic studies, True Father pushed himself hard to have many different life
experiences, among the working class, the middle class and the upper class. In order to prepare
himself for his revolutionary mission, he tried to break through every limitation and accumulate
abilities to deal with any circumstance that might arise on his way to the final destination. When
he received money from home for his school and living expenses, he used it to help those in need;
then he went out to do the work of a laborer. Among many other things, he carried an A-frame on
his back and pulled a delivery cart. Shedding blood and sweat, he became a friend and brother to
his fellow laborers, sharing their pain and their joy. Through training himself in this way, he
personally experienced the teaching, "The one who would become a glorious king must be
victorious over all kinds of pain."
8. I did not reveal my thoughts about my mission to others. Even my friends did not know. I studied the
Bible and read books on religion and philosophy, which ordinary people usually did not do. One of my
friends majored in politics and economics at Waseda University. He was studying communism, and this
led to a fierce debate between us. I once delivered a loud, impassioned speech on the side of the road. I
did this where many people had gathered to view the cherry blossoms. I spoke strongly on the issues of
the time, and urged the youth to act this way and that for the sake of the future. The predictions I made
then are now coming true. Some of my friends happened to join the crowd; they were quite astonished
when they saw it was I who was giving the speech. (015-182, 1965/10/08)
9. After receiving a recommendation from my school in Seoul, I entered Waseda Technical High School.
But I studied books about religion more than school-related subjects. I studied the Bible carefully to
uncover its hidden truths. There was one particular Bible page I could not understand even after
struggling for five years. That one page contained the root problem of human history. I had to completely
and clearly solve the most difficult and complex issues in the Bible. This is how the Principle came to
emerge into the world. Since, together with heaven, I unraveled the truth, heaven cannot ignore this.
Heaven knows all about it. (571-190, 2007/08/10)
10. Before I turned 20 years of age, I went through a course of bloody tears. I knew I could not enter
God's realm of heart unless I had the heart to be friends with beggars and love them as if they were my
own older brother or my own mother. So I lived with the heart to love everyone. I trained myself the same
way in Japan, but this time with a heart to go beyond the nation. I helped my friends pay their tuition by
making money as a laborer at a construction site. You too should walk such a path. Why did I do it? I
volunteered to travel the most difficult path because I knew God's path has been even more difficult.
(137-286, 1986/01/03)
11. On days when it snowed or when typhoon winds raged, I went to work at a construction site rather
than going to school. It felt good to challenge such harsh weather. Rain from the typhoon would wash the
dirt and soot from my hands. Amid the storm I worked hard and sweated copiously. I felt so refreshed
from it. When I saw a person behaving badly, I scolded him. Sometimes I had to deal with people who
were bigger than me, but I defeated them. When a foreman exploited the laborers by taking 30 percent of
their wages, I strongly protested. Most people feared the man, but I was not submissive; I admonished
him to stop. In the end he surrendered to me. (015-181, 1965/10/08)
12. When I was in Tokyo I worked pulling a cart as a deliveryman, making deliveries in 27 different
districts. I decided to do the job not because I needed the money but because I wanted the training. If you
find yourself working in a transportation company, you should become more knowledgeable about the
work than the company veterans. If not, how can you persuade them to take you seriously? During the
summer I transported telephone poles on a cart. Once there was an incident: As I came to an intersection,
a pole shifted to one side, causing my cart to spin around. Sensing danger, all the passersby, men and
women, scattered. I can still picture it in my mind. I have another unforgettable memory, about when I
lived in a slum. I covered myself with a ragged blanket, and my clothes became infested with lice. I am
God's Son, but I volunteered to become a frontline soldier, a guerrilla of sorts, in order to conquer Satan's
world. (199-174, 1990/02/16)
13. The times in Japan when I worked at a construction site and pulled a cart in Ginza remain vivid
memories. I did not do that work just to make a living. I did it to set the example of how young people
should go through difficulties. I had friends who had stopped going to school. I wanted to help them
graduate, so I withdrew from school for several months and took on the role of their parents. I had no time
to sleep at night. I woke up as early as two in the morning and went out to work to make money for their
tuition. Why did I do that? It was not because I was not as smart as them. It was to serve them. For this I
did all kinds of work, including working for a company, selling my calligraphy and working as a
foreman. (026-069, 1969/10/18)
14. I am very knowledgeable about the world. When I was young I traveled to every corner of Korea. I
visited many places in Japan when I was studying there. I also did all sorts of work. I was an errand-boy
for a large company. No matter how I was mistreated, I did not complain. People regarded me as nothing
but a student from abroad, but they did not know what was in my mind. I did not even mind living in a
slum. After all, we must train ourselves to have real ability to deal with any situation and bring good
results in whatever we do. (189-299, 1989/06/17) 

#### The path of true love
During his time of study in Japan, True Father practiced his own motto, "Before you desire
dominion over the universe, first have dominion over yourself." He trained himself repeatedly in
order to control his five senses. Among other things, he trained himself not to be ticklish and to
look away from temptation. In order to live for heaven's heart rather than follow a selfish human
heart, he constantly reminded himself, "I must love the Japanese people more than I love my own
people." He trained himself to sincerely love the people of what was then an enemy nation as if
they were his own parents or his own older brother.
15. When I was young and preparing for my mission, I would not even go near a movie theater. Until I
could achieve total self-control, I did not walk in front of a bar. Unless we gain total control over
ourselves, we are bound to fail in whatever we do. What is the most difficult obstacle to achieving selfcontrol? It is sleep. Hunger is next. After that is sexual desire. These are the three enemies. Therefore, as a
course of training I purposely did not sleep, I did not eat, and I lived a life of purity. Until we have
dominion over ourselves, we cannot have dominion over the universe. Only after we govern ourselves can
we govern the universe. We are not entitled to call on God for help or hope to enter the realm of God's
dominion unless we first achieve mastery over ourselves. This is the view of the Principle. Adam fell
because he did not have self-control. (131-322, 1984/05/19)
16. When I was in wartime Japan, I walked around the back alleys in the red light district of Shinjuku,
Tokyo. I observed people and listened to them wherever I went in order to gain something helpful for my
mission. If we are ready to deal with even the most evil places, we can digest anything. This is my
philosophy. I am not the kind of person who goes around looking for an easy or comfortable environment.
The idea that in order to cultivate the mind you must go to the deep mountains or to a quiet and
magnificent place makes no sense to me. Studying only in tranquil places does not work for me. I could
study well even in noisy factories where high-powered engines and motors were running. I trained myself
in many different ways. Once, when a group of strong men were harassing a weaker man, I fought and
defeated them singlehandedly. I did not do it for recognition. It was a matter of my philosophy, of what is
necessary in life. (015-131, 1965/10/03)
17. My hope is greater than yours; it is as high as a great mountain. However, because I knew that the
time was coming when I would have to push many people to travel the road of a servant, I first pushed
myself to take the position of a servant. Had I not lived the life of a servant myself, I would not be
qualified to call others to do it. If I wanted others to live the life of a servant, I needed to live the life of a
servant first. I had to become a servant for the sake of my country of Korea. This is why I once became a
servant of three-year-old children and served them faithfully morning and evening. I attended those
children as if each were God. Also, when I was studying in Japan, I lived in a slum swarming with lice. I
carried loads of coal and loads of salt. I welcomed all kinds of experiences that others would shrink from.
This is my personal story, and some bitter sorrow remains. You should alleviate my bitter sorrow. What
then should be your starting point? What is it that you need to grab onto as the basis of your own
emotional resolve? It should be to represent me. When you go to those places, you should go on my
behalf. Although you may receive persecution, when you shed tears for the people there, you will feel my
blood throbbing in your veins. (025-212, 1969/10/04)
18. I studied the subject of what people will not do. For instance, people do not want to skip meals. So I
pondered, "Can I endure not eating?" And I said to myself, "Yes, I can." So I started training myself not
to eat. I was then so hungry that if anyone served me a meal I could have quickly devoured three or four
bowls of rice. One day I thought to myself, "Let me see how much I can eat." As it was the middle of a
war, we received ration coupons. Taking all my ration coupons, I took my friends to a restaurant and said,
"Let's eat as much as we can and see what our limit is." We wolfed down more and more. I ate seven
servings of rice covered with fried eggs and chicken. After seven servings I was so full I could not even
turn my neck around. It was more painful than being hungry.
I gave myself that experience. However, you would be seriously mistaken if you think I did it all the time.
In fact, I was always hungry. Why do you think I made myself go hungry? If I only cared about keeping
my stomach full, how could I keep people with me and keep God with me? So although I was hungry and
wanted to eat, I resolved that I must love my people and God more than food. This was truth to me; it was
my creed. (015-183, 1965/10/08)
19. When I was a student in Tokyo, on rainy days while still wearing my student uniform I would
purposely mix with laborers who smelled from their dirty, wet clothes. I went to the places that smelled
the worst. Standing next to them, I thought, "What if these people were my older brother or my father? If
they were enduring these miserable conditions for me, what must I do for them?" When I rode the trolley
to school, I would look around at the students all well dressed in their uniforms and compare them to
those laborers. And I would think, "You are in the springtime of your life, all smiles and laughter, but in
time this will all disappear. However, my way of thinking leads to a life that will shine and rise up like the
sun to a hopeful future. My future is more or less assured, but your future is less certain."
You must understand that upholding and living up to the name of True Parents throughout my entire life
has been extremely difficult. I had to cultivate such qualities in myself that people of every status, high or
low, could relate to me as their subject partner. (117-019, 1982/01/30)
20. During my time of studying in Japan, I would occasionally visit my home in Jeongju. I generally did
not send telegrams to my parents to tell them when I was coming. My home was about eight kilometers
from the train station, and I wanted to walk home. I enjoyed walking on cold, windy, snowy or rainy
days. As I prayed while walking down the road, I realized even more what a magnificent world we live in,
and I could not help but be amazed at the Maker who created it. I have unforgettable memories of nights
when I walked home after sunset, or nights when white snow was falling. Carrying small gifts for my
parents in both hands, I delighted in imagining the expressions they would have on their faces. Whenever
I think of it, I become nostalgic. I realize how blessed I was at that time in my life. (018-243, 1967/06/11) 

#### Graduation and return to Korea
Due to a change of circumstances in Japan caused by the war, True Fathers study in Japan was
cut short by one semester. Hence he graduated earlier than expected, on September 30, 1943, in
the 25th graduating class of Waseda Technical School. After graduation True Father purchased
a ticket for an October 4 departure on the ship from Shimonoseki to Busan and sent his family a
telegram giving the date and time of his arrival in Busan. On the departure day, as he entered the
train station in Tokyo with his friends who were sending him off, he suddenly felt uneasy. He did
not know why, but it was as if his feet were weighed down and he could hardly drag himself onto
the train. So he decided to postpone his journey home.
The ship that departed that day, the one for which True Father had purchased a ticket, was called
the Gonnon Maru. On October 5 at 1:15 a.m., about ten nautical miles northeast of Oki-noshima,
the ship was sunk by an American torpedo. True Fathers family was in total shock when they
heard the news of the sinking. They had not heard that Father had changed his departure date. As
True Father was journeying back home in the middle of October, he made a solemn resolution:
This time I am coming home without having been able to dissolve the bitter sorrow of my people.
Yet in the near future the time will come when I will be able to teach Japanese youth and guide
them to do God's Will. Then we will meet again.
21. When I graduated from my school in Japan, it was the middle of the Second World War. For military
reasons they graduated my class in September, six months earlier than normal. I sent a telegram to my
hometown informing my family of my arrival time on the ship from Shimonoseki to Busan. But in the
midst of the war that ship was sunk. Back in my hometown, my family checked the passenger list of that
ill-fated ship, but they could not find my name. Everyone thought I had died, which caused a great
commotion throughout my village. (015-147, 1965/10/03)
22. The sinking of the Gonnon Maru was in 1943. I was scheduled to board that ship in order to return to
Korea from Japan. My graduation had been advanced by six months, and I bought a ticket from Tokyo to
Seoul that included passage on the ship, which was to depart from Shimonoseki. But as soon as I entered
the Tokyo train station to catch the train to Shimonoseki, I felt uneasy. So although I had already
purchased the ticket, I did not take that train. Shortly after purchasing my train ticket, I sent a telegram to
my family giving them the scheduled date and time of my arrival. Based on that schedule, my family in
my hometown expected that I would come home on a certain day and time. However, after I had my
premonition I left the Tokyo station and instead went with my friends who had come to send me off. I
believe we went to a place called Atami. Consequently, I did not board the ship that ended up sinking.
In the meantime, since I did not come home, my family in my hometown, to whom I had sent the
telegram, thought I had died. My mother went nearly insane. She dropped everything and hurriedly
traveled to Busan to find me. It is 230 kilometers from Jeongju to Seoul; the journey took ten hours by
train. Then she took another train from Seoul to Busan. You can hardly imagine her mental and emotional
state during that journey. She did not even put on a dress; she ran out of the house only in her house
clothes, which are like pajamas. Her shoes came off as she ran to the train station nearest Jeongju, but she
did not notice; she did not even feel that an acacia tree thorn had embedded itself in the sole of her foot. A
callous hardened over it, and I heard that she did not pull it out until after I returned home. I then realized,
"Ah, this is the greatness of a parents love!" (125-310, 1983/03/29)
