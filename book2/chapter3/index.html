<h2 id="section-1-love-for-nature">Section 1. Love for Nature</h2>
<h3 id="lessons-from-nature">Lessons from nature</h3>
<p>True Father spent about 18 years of his life within about ten kilometers of his birthplace. That
area was the stage of his activities until he graduated from primary school. This was an
important time in his life, when he learned about nature and had many realizations from
observing and experiencing it. As he studied nature, he showed unusual interest, inquisitiveness
and passion for learning. Numerous experiences with the world of nature and his agricultural
surroundings nurtured his emotional sensitivity and depth. As he observed the love of birds and
insects for their young, he verified the principles of human love. All things in nature became his
friends, and they also became his textbooks of heart and love.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As we grow up, our hometown provides us with abundant opportunities for learning and emotional
growth. Just by looking at the mountains, we realize that they are enveloped by a huge net of heart -- it is
unforgettable. It is the same for a creek with the variety of fish and insects that live there. We can grow
when we utilize all of the creation as our basic textbooks, from which we can learn and gain knowledge
that we never forget. We can learn from all the animals and plants in the mountains and indeed every
single thing in the natural world. What we find in our hometown provides us with abundant materials to
help us learn and grow internally in heart and feeling. That is why we miss the mountains, fields and
rivers of our hometown. (187-294, 1989/02/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was a child, I went everywhere in my village, the neighboring villages, the mountains and over
the mountains, with the thought to go and see everything throughout the land. That is how I was in my
childhood. I went to a reservoir and caught the different kinds of fish that lived there. I caught all kinds of
birds. I caught all kinds of insects. There was nothing there that I did not catch. That is how I became
knowledgeable about the things around me. I knew where the crabs lived, where the different species of
fish lived, what animals lived where, and so on. Having discovered and investigated all their dens and
nests, I knew very well what creatures lived in each place. That is why I knew the best fishing spots.
(271-259, 1995/08/28)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not spend much time in the fields. Every day I roamed throughout the mountains. In the
mountains there are all kinds of flowers, all kinds of birds and all kinds of wild animals. Everything is
there; it is like a natural museum. Human beings have learned how to make many things by imitating
nature. We have to love nature. On the night of a full moon, I never wanted to stay home and sleep. There
is something mystical about the night of a full moon. On such nights I would go into the pine forest deep
in the mountains and sleep where the wolves and tigers lived. I would lie down on a bed of pine needles
underneath a huge pine tree, where weeds do not grow and where you do not get wet even when it rains.
You cannot imagine what a marvelous feeling it was to sleep there. When you go to such a place and see
the bright moon, even the blowing breeze will sound mystical to you. And when a tall tree shakes in the
wind, it will reflect all kinds of colors, and you will be entranced by them. Mysteriously, the trees jostling
with each other will sound like people talking together. The Principle can be found in the natural
environment rather than in other places. (562-165, 2007/05/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I truly love nature. I used to go to the mountains and just enjoy nature while sitting on the grass.
Sometimes I would fall asleep leaning against a large tree with nature all around. I picked wild vegetables
and ate them. These were unforgettable experiences. I believe that nature provided me with the
fundamental materials that facilitated my emotional growth. When I observed the trees in the mountains
and by the streams, although they were all trees, no two looked the same. That made a deep impression on
me. Nature is a museum containing all kinds of materials that each of us can find memorable. (187-295,
1989/02/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew all the migrating birds that came to my village. Once I saw a flock of migrating birds that I had
never seen before. They were so colorful and beautiful. I wondered where these birds would hatch their
eggs, since they had migrated away and returned after having their young. I also wondered why they
came to my neighborhood. I thought it had to be one of two reasons, either for water or to nest. Birds
drink water, but they want good water. So I looked for a good source of water and found a spring. I
thought to myself that they would come there for water. So I went to that spring every day and waited for
the birds to come. I waited for about two weeks. Then, indeed, they came! Birds are truly fascinating
creatures. (180-245, 1988/08/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a brook in my hometown. I caught many kinds of freshwater fish that were living there,
including mudfish and eels. I thought, if I had a large pond at my house I would bring them home and put
them in it. These days it is relatively easy for people to have a pond at home and to raise fish. How
wonderful it would have been if I could have done that! We simply could not do it back then. But, still
young and not knowing any better, I simply dug a water hole and put some small fish in it. I thought that
fish could live in any kind of water. But, after keeping them there overnight, the next morning I
discovered they had all died. Without knowing that they needed certain conditions in order to live, I sadly
said, "I invested all of my sincerity so you could live; why did you die?" Looking at those dead fish, I
said, "Oh, your mom will cry over your death. I will cry for you too." There, alone, I cried for the fish.
From this, you can tell that I am a caring person. (187-294, 1989/02/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a champion at catching eels. The sea was about eight kilometers from my home, and I could
travel there and back faster than most people. When I was young, my nickname was Tiny Eyes. Rumors
spread, "Tiny Eyes catches dozens of eels every day and steams them; then he even feeds them to the pigs
and cows." Villagers who heard the rumors came to my house and talked about eels. Then, after telling
my mother to prepare to cook eels, I would run out to catch them. By mealtime I was back with the eels I
had caught, and my mother would serve them to the visitors either stewed or steamed, whichever way
they preferred. They could eat as much as they desired, enjoying eel to their hearts' content. (615-148,
2009/08/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the creation exists for the sake of human beings. Therefore, once we possess the qualifications to
be its owner, with the ability to truly love even the tiniest living things, we will not feel ashamed but
stand with dignity to receive the love of God. That is why puppies want to receive love from us; sparrows
and even spiders want the same. All creatures want to receive love from human beings. In the old days, I
was a champion at catching birds. There was no kind of bird in my neighborhood that I did not catch.
When migratory birds came into my area, I even caught them; I would not go to sleep until I had caught
them. This is how I was when I was a little boy. When I grew older, I dug a birdbath for the birds and left
food for them. After I had invested my loving heart in digging the birdbath, they came and drank. I
brought food for them and sprinkled it on the ground; then they would not fly away when they saw me
coming. When birds come to understand that you will not harm them, they will surely like you. That is
because human beings are their lords. (173-027, 1988/02/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When spring comes every animal goes about searching for its mate. Birds do that, and so do insects.
When the season turns to summer, try listening to the sounds of insects. There are exactly two kinds. One
is the sound of crying from hunger. The other is the sound of singing, looking for a mate. The signals are
simple. One is signaling to its friends, "I am hungry; let's go together and eat." The other signals, "Come
with me; I am a good mate for you." These are the two kinds of signals they make. Living in the
countryside, there were many insects for me to catch. Also, I caught many different kinds of animals:
lynx, raccoon and rabbits. It was fun and very exciting. I thought that they were living alone, but in fact
each had its own mate. All were in pairs. It is the same with the insect world and the world of birds. (140-
296, 1986/02/14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the Korean white pine tree because it bears fruit -- pine nuts -- that we can eat. However, these
pine nuts cannot be shelled easily. You must use a stone to smash the shell. Even if you know what to do,
your aim must be precise; otherwise, the shell will not open. That is why I say that not just anyone can
shell them. Another thing about the white pine: when you plant it, it only germinates when the ground is
frozen. Hence, its planting time is opposite that of other plants. Because it must freeze, you should not
plant it in spring, but in the autumn.<br />
Nothing can change the nature of a Korean white pine. It is not influenced by the conditions of its
environment; on the contrary, it carries an attribute that causes it to burst out even if it finds itself in the
most severe environment. Then with the arrival of spring, its seeds will sprout and grow into Korean
white pine trees. That is the nature of a Korean white pine. The tree has five needles in each cluster: one
representing the center and the others representing the east, west, north and south. That is why I love the
Korean white pine tree. Also, this tree grows very well. It grows straight up. It sends its root straight
down, and its trunk grows straight up. (178-119, 1988/06/01)</p>

<h3 id="training-in-self-sufficiency">Training in self-sufficiency</h3>
<p>In his childhood, True Father experienced all the tasks of farming, including plowing rice
paddies, plowing fields, planting rice and weeding rice. He learned through experience the
secrets for successfully growing rice, beans, corn, sweet potatoes and other crops. He did not
mind spreading manure and raking leaves. He eagerly took part in every kind of work and
learned to do the best job he could in whatever he was doing. He also learned how to mend his
clothes and knit his own socks, hats and gloves. In this way, he trained himself to live alone,
without needing to depend on others.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As soon as I came back from school, I would take off my school shirt and jump into farm work. I was
always on the job ahead of my siblings, even my older brother and older sisters. I thought, "Unless I earn
the title of champion farmer, I cannot become the leader of the farmers' world." So I taught myself how to
become the best farmer. I became an expert on where to plant regular beans and where to plant red beans.
I learned how to tell what crop would be best for the soil by looking at the ground. Without hesitation I
would say, "Sweet potatoes should flourish here. Why did you plant something else?" Others responded,
"How do you know that?" I learned it all through experience. Hence, when I go to a rural community, I
am a farmer's farmer. It is the same when I go to a fishing village. I invented an unsinkable boat, and I
developed a unique and effective system for catching tuna. (220-333, 1991/10/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knitted my own socks and made my own clothes. When the weather got cold, I made a hat and wore
it. I am the one who taught knitting to my older sisters. In order to fulfill your mission for the Will, you
must train yourself to be self-sufficient. When I needed underwear, I got a roll of cloth, cut it to a pattern
and made some. When I put them on, they fit perfectly. I even made Korean socks for my mother. She
said, "I thought you were making them for fun, but they fit me so well!" You should be able to do all
these kinds of things based on your own study. You should know how to make your own clothes, socks
and hats. If you can do that, even if you live alone you will be able to accomplish your responsibility for
the Will. (222-271, 1991/11/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These days, there is one kind of food that I miss. I have tried all the famous dishes in the world. Is
there a food anywhere that I have not tasted? Yet, I still miss this one food. In the olden days in the
countryside, farmers had to pass through a period called the "May potato challenge." Having used up all
our grains through the winter, in the month of May we had only potatoes to eat. Then finally the spring
barley harvest arrived, after which we had barley to cook and eat. The barley that I am talking about is not
the pearl barley that you buy at the store, but uncracked barley. The grains have to be soaked in water for
some time before cooking them. When we put them in our bowls, if we pressed them down firmly with a
spoon, individual grains would break loose and fly out of the bowl. I remember eating it mixed with
Korean hot pepper paste. This is the dish that I miss even now. It is not tasty if you mix it with anything
else; it must be hot pepper paste. Whenever I put a spoonful of that reddish barley into my mouth, the
grains would constantly come out through my teeth. I closed my lips tightly in order to eat it. I had to take
time because it was so difficult to chew. I miss those olden days. (212-180, 1991/01/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living in the country, you can have a lot of fun and many wonderful experiences. That is where I
learned everything I needed and collected all the necessary information to prepare myself to build the
monumental house of God's Will for the future. The many experiences I had doing things in nature were
how I taught myself to be an expert in whatever I did. When I go to a rural area I can become a farmer,
and when I go to the sea I can become a fisherman. When I went out net fishing, I left home early in the
morning and totally invested myself with the conviction that I would set a new record. I went out with the
cry of the rooster at the crack of dawn and did not return home from my labors until the stars came out.
All my life, my personal motto has always been to do my very best to set a new world record. That is why
wherever I go, whatever I do, I think that I will never be defeated by anyone. And actually, I am never
defeated. I also keep this standard when it comes to making conditions of devotion. (050-303,
1971/11/08)</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="training-of-heart">Training of heart</h3>
<p>In his childhood, True Father shed many tears. He was an extremely deep-hearted and
compassionate boy. When he was raising birds or fish at home, if one of them died he was drawn
by compassion to shed tears for it, thinking of its mother who would grieve for her young. He
defended his friends when they were bullied by stronger boys. Whenever he heard that someone
was going hungry or starving, he would take rice from the rice jar at home and bring it to him or
her, without letting his parents know. When he happened upon a mother who had just given birth
but had no food to eat, he brought her rice and the seaweed to make the soup that Korean women
eat after having a baby. When his friends' parents could not afford to buy them the new clothes
that were customarily prepared for children on traditional holidays, he gave them his own new
clothes. These are some of the ways he expressed his deep heart for whoever was suffering
hardship.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I became mature enough to feel compassion for others shortly after I turned seven, the age when I
started going to the village school. I used to figure out when the pregnant women in the village were
about to give birth by looking at the size of their bellies. One day I found out that one of the women who
was pregnant had no rice at home. So, one month before she had the baby I gave her rice and seaweed for
the seaweed soup all mothers have after delivery. This is why the poor people of my village confided in
me all of their secrets.<br />
I felt responsible to care for people who were having difficulties, whatever their situation. Every year in
the autumn I would pick chestnuts for them. I would save some of the stock of corn at my house and
bring it to their homes. It is the only way I could feel at peace. It is from this kind of background that I
have a foundation even to think of feeding all the people of the world. (431-107, 2004/01/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was young, my family was quite well off. When my friends who were poor came to school
with cooked millet or barley in their lunch boxes, I traded my lunch box with them. I could not just eat
my own well-prepared food with rice while watching them eat such meager food. If my friend's mother or
father was sick but had no money to see a doctor, I would go to my mother and father and tearfully ask
them for money, explaining my friend's situation. When I was about 11 years old, I told my father that I
was going to sell rice to help someone out. But even before he approved, I helped myself to as much rice
as I could and scooped it into a bag. I was in such a hurry that I did not even tie the mouth of the bag.
Then I carried it over my shoulder and walked some eight kilometers to the market to sell it. I should have
tied up the bag with a string. But since I did not, I had to hold on tight to keep the rice from spilling. I
walked as fast as I could, fearing that my father would come after me. You have no idea how much my
heart pounded and how hard I gasped for air. I cannot forget it to this day; I do not think I will forget it for
the rest of my life. All those experiences enabled me to stand in the position to take the path for the Will.

<li>
<p>My nature is such that whenever I saw a shivering beggar passing by my house during the winter, I
could not eat or sleep. So I would ask my mother and father to bring the beggar in to our main room and
feed him well before sending him off. Don't you think that this is a basis to be loved by heaven?
Whenever I heard through the grapevine that someone in my neighborhood was starving, I could not fall
asleep at night wondering how I could help him. I would scoop rice out of my family's rice jar and give it
to the hungry person without letting my parents know. (056-035, 1972/05/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like rice cakes; so I used to ask my mother, "Please make some rice cakes." But she was always too
busy farming, weaving or making clothes in preparation for the marriage of her children. My mother
indeed had no time to rest. But I kept asking her to make me rice cakes, and finally she would make some
simple ones, such as red bean rice cakes or steamed rice cakes. She made them in a large earthenware
steamer. But they would not last even three days because I would share them. That is how I was.
Whenever I had some concern for my village, I could not fall asleep. I realize that heaven has been
guiding me since childhood to have such a caring heart. That is why whenever I saw someone in my
village who was poor, I wanted to help that person in any way I could. When there was a problem in the
village, I did everything possible to resolve it. I believed that this was my job, not someone else's.
Without having this core nature within me, I could not be who I am today. It had to be my inborn nature.
There is a Korean maxim, "The water at the surface must be clear for the water at the bottom to be clear."
The "top water" is the leader who sets the example. Human beings are spiritual. So, when we have the
quality of pure water, others will want to come and live together with us. They will lean on us for support.

<li>
<p>When I was young we had a bee farm with hundreds of hives full of bees. When you do bee farming,
you have to set up honeycomb frames; then the bees make their homes there and when they make their
honey they save it there. Honeycomb frames were expensive. Normally the frames with their empty
honeycombs were stacked and stored on a cabinet, but I found them and mashed the waxen honeycombs
together to make candles. Many people in the country had no light at night because they could not afford
to buy kerosene. So I gave them the candles that I made, thinking that since I could not give them
kerosene, at least I should give them candles. I had to do it because otherwise I felt so uneasy; I could not
bear doing nothing for them. That is why I mashed all the honeycombs together to make candles and
distributed them to each house. At that time I was just a child, so I had no idea how expensive they were!
After finding out what I did, my father scolded me severely. Yet I never admitted that I had done anything
wrong; how can it be wrong to help those in need? So after scolding me for some time, my father just
gave up and stopped. (163-159, 1987/05/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disabled couple lived in my village. The husband was blind, and his wife was crippled. Even so,
this couple was regarded in the village as an exemplary couple. Though the wife limped while leaning on
her cane, she always guided her husband everywhere he needed to go. Her mouth was crooked and she
had all sorts of physical problems, but her husband loved her very much, more than he would love a
beauty queen. They had no place to live, so when the winter came they would stay in my family's mill.
They had only a straw mat, so I would bring them my pad and my quilt. For that reason, they liked me
very much. One day I heard they had passed away. I was so sad; I remember crying over their deaths.
(420-211, 2003/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like you, I too had a lively youth overflowing with hope. But even before I knew the Will, I wanted
to become a friend to those in pain and suffering. I was greatly interested in people who were not doing
well. I did not try to become close to the children of well-to-do and influential families. Most people did
that, but I did the opposite. If I knew there was a poor person in the village who had nothing to eat, I
could not sleep. I had to do everything I could to solve the situation. In this way, I wanted to follow a path
to become friends, even close friends, with everyone. (117-018, 1982/01/30)</p>

<h3 id="gifts-of-the-spirit">Gifts of the Spirit</h3>
<p>From childhood, True Fathers personality was such that whenever he took a path, he would
follow it to the end. His tenacious spirit helped him to succeed in whatever he did. Once he
decided that something was the right thing to do, he acted on it immediately. Thus, during his
childhood he cultivated the abilities and character traits he would need to fulfill God's
providence of salvation as the True Parent. Furthermore, even as a child he surprised people
around him with his predictions regarding people's illnesses or problems that would occur in the
future. This was one special ability he had.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My mother, my father and everyone in the village counted on me. I was known as the fearfully sharp
and smart one in the Moon clan. I could do anything. Wrestling, boxing or any other sport -- I excelled at
them all. I was always one of the top three students in my class in school. As soon as I determined to
become the number one student and not just one of the top three, I achieved it. Why? I would study twice,
even three times harder than the number one student. That is the kind of person I am. That is why, when I
probed into the fundamental issues of life and religion, I could root out what had been unknown and
reveal it to the world. My personality is such that once I set my mind to do something, I forget to eat or
sleep until I finish it. That is the most necessary quality for the work of restoration through indemnity.
(319-112, 2000/03/17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a child, once I started crying for some reason, I did not stop even after an hour; I cried about it all
day long. Hence, I was given the nickname "All-day Crier." Not only that, when I cried I did not cry
quietly; I cried at the top of my lungs so that the whole village heard me crying. I wanted every elder in
the village to come and see what was going on. I cried so hard that I would wake people from their sleep.
I cried and cried as if something terrible had gone wrong. In the end, my throat would swell up and I
could not make any more sounds. Also, when I cried I did not just sit still. I jumped up and down and
bumped into things, so that I would cut myself here and there and be covered with blood. This should be
enough for you to understand my personality. Reflecting on this, God is truly wise. He made me such that
once I start something, I never let go of it. (050-297, 1971/11/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a strong and healthy youth with an active and passionate personality. The scope of my activities
was three times greater than that of ordinary people. When it snowed I did not sleep, but instead I went
out at night hunting for weasels. Following their tracks in the snow I would walk and walk, even
forgetting that I was getting hungry. I gave my mother such a hard time. Definitely I was an unusual boy
with indomitable tenacity. When I was in my teens I already had my father and mother on a string. With
one wrong move my father and mother would find themselves trapped; then they had no choice but to
surrender to me. I am doing what I am doing today only because I was capable of such things from an
early age. My parents sometimes scolded me, but I would never give in, no matter what. All they asked of
me was to admit that I did wrong, but I refused. Since I truly believed I had done nothing wrong, why
would I admit to it? (136-132, 1985/12/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one in the world can match the tenacity of my character. In my childhood I fought a boy who was
stronger than me, and he beat me. From that moment on for three to four months, I could not sleep in
peace until I finally bested him. That is how tenacious I am. People could say I am a person who is to be
greatly feared, because I absolutely despise losing. I never let anything defeat me. When I do something, I
strive for victory; the thought of defeat never crosses my mind. I already know that win or lose, once I
start something I will keep striving until I achieve victory; otherwise I will die. That is the kind of
personality I have. (056-284, 1972/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a very quick-tempered personality. I cannot ignore even a single swear word directed at me. If
someone hits me even once I cannot stand idle. I also detest losing to anyone. I have all these extreme
aspects in my character. However, because of such traits I excel at many things. I determine to win at any
sport I play. My brain is not bad, either. Imagine then, how I, with this kind of personality, had to endure
and swallow things that were simply unbearable. Many times, even hundreds of times, I had to accept
situations that could not have been more humiliating. But I overcame them all. It is because God took a
similar path. God must also have this same kind of fiery character; and, beyond that, He is capable of
wiping out the whole world. But this world still remains because God holds back His anger and endures
all manner of difficulties. (065-328, 1973/03/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was young, I never lost a wrestling match against anyone else in my age group. However, I
once lost a wrestling match to a boy in my village three years older than me. So I looked for a way to beat
him. Spring arrived. Anyone who has lived in a rural area knows that in springtime when acacia trees
have absorbed plenty of moisture, their bark can be peeled off like white pine bark. So I went to an acacia
tree and bent its trunk back and forth until its bark started peeling, and stripped it off all the way down. Its
bark is tough. Then, I continually wrestled with that bare acacia tree-trunk. I wrestled it while telling
myself, "I'll never rest until I beat you!" Six months after he beat me, I finally beat that boy; I sat on top
of him on the ground. I focused on nothing else, forgetting to eat or sleep, until I could achieve that. (139-
052, 1986/01/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ever since I was eight years old, I was able to match people by looking at their pictures. I matched
many couples from all over the village, including my own older sister and some of my more distant
relatives. Also, I could see the future. When I said, "It is going to rain," it would rain without fail. When I
said that a certain person in this town would die within a week, it in fact would happen. There were many
instances like that. So people came to me with a picture of a person whom they were considering for
marriage. They would ask me, "Look at this picture. Do you think this person is a good match or a bad
one?" I would answer at one glance. If I said "Bad" but, nevertheless, they went ahead with it, it turned
out to be bad. If I said "Good," it actually turned out to be a good marriage. I was that accurate, even
though I did not look at the picture for very long. This is the kind of record I have. (113-236, 1981/05/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my village I was known as the tiny-eyed boy from that Osan house. Everyone knew me by that
nickname because my eyes were so small. I was told that after my mother gave birth to me, she examined
my face for a long time, thinking I might be missing my eyes. Only when I blinked did she finally feel
relieved. I needed such eyes. It is because I was born with eyes that can see objects in the far distance that
I came to a complete understanding of not only this world, but even the heart and situation of God. The
whole world will follow after me once they discover the true value of this. If they lined up across the
world, the line of people who would want to come and see me would extend across the Korea Strait, all
the way to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. (204-089, 1990/07/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also had an eye for cows. I was able to tell at a glance whether or not a cow was worth buying.
Whenever I said, "That cow is not a good cow to buy," my father did not buy it. Good cows have a
handsome neckline, forelegs and hind legs and a good waistline. A good cow must meet these four
conditions. In my boyhood, when I went to the cattle market with my father, I inspected the cows for him.
When I told my father things about cows that he was not so knowledgeable about, he asked me, "How do
you know all that?" In fact, I was born with this knowledge. That is why today I am able to do things that
no one else in this world is capable of doing. (120-138, 1982/10/05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have always been a good judge of character. When I looked at someone on the street and got the
feeling, "He must be such-and-such a person," I would follow him around to see if my intuition was
correct. I would ask him, "You did so and so, right?" It was not something that the spirit world taught me;
I just felt it in my heart. So I confronted him, "You did so and so, right?" He would be surprised and say,
"How did you know?" My reading of that person was accurate. Even sitting in my room, I could
immediately tell who was in the next room, whether that person was doing something good or bad, and
whether he was living as a good person or a bad person. (040-298, 1971/02/07)</p>

<h2 id="section-2-gods-call">Section 2. God's Call</h2>
<h3 id="family-indemnity">Family indemnity</h3>
<p>Before True Father was called by God, his family and relatives had to pay severe indemnity.
Until he reached the age of 16, his family was assaulted by all kinds of trials and tribulations.
For the sake of the providence sacrifices were their inevitable lot. They made the final sacrificial
condition to clear away Satan's accusation in order to secure the complete foundational point for
the victory on heaven's side. For three generations there were children who died away from
home, their whereabouts unknown. Notably, out of True Fathers 12 siblings, the five brothers and
sisters for whom he cared the most died at very young ages. In this way heaven completely
severed him from relationships that he could depend on, and from the people he most loved. This
was so he would no longer be attached to worldly things. After his call as well, True Father had
to live every day of his life without any relationships with people in whom he could find shelter,
or to whom he would pay special attention. This is how he lived, wherever he was in the world.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Unification Church is walking the path for the Will. In order to inherit this Will, all members must
go through a course of indemnification. I began this course when I was 16 years old. By that time, five of
my parents' 13 children had died and only eight remained alive. Not only did people die, but also much
livestock -- dogs, cows and horses. Evil spirits stirred themselves. You may not be familiar with such
things. Truly, many strange phenomena occurred that were difficult to understand. They were
undoubtedly the cunning schemes of the devil to destroy my family. However I am telling you they really
happened.<br />
Before I rise up triumphantly representing all nations of the world, I need to set up a condition that Satan
cannot accuse. In the course of my battle against Satan, he attacked my family. That was the price we had
to pay. Likewise, I also need to present a condition upon which I can stand proudly before history, by
claiming the right of victory over Satan as the representative of all peoples and nations of the world. The
same condition applies to Unification Church members; the same condition is required to found a unified
nation. (214-215, 1991/02/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spiritual phenomena do not happen only in the invisible world. They manifest in various forms and
ways in the visible world as well. Satan plotted and mobilized every means to bring my family to ruin.
One thing he did was drive my older brother and older sister insane, and this caused much havoc. When I
was young I witnessed such spiritual phenomena and problems that arose from the spirit world acting
behind the scenes. One day I saw that my older brother, whom I thought had gone mad, was talking. He
seemed to be murmuring to himself, but when I listened to him carefully, I recognized that the substance
of his words was formidable. Also, the way he spoke changed depending on the situation. Apparently, a
number of spirits would come and talk with him all day long. I could see immediately that this was
happening. (227-116, 1992/02/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of my friends who were closest and dearest to me, the ones who most deserved heaven's blessing,
were taken away. Anyone whom I could trust and count on was completely cut off from my life. Some of
them were from North Pyeongan Province and some were from Hwanghae Province. They were my best
friends, but they were all taken away. Then my younger sister, the closest in age to me and whom I
adored the most, was taken away. My parents had many daughters, while my aunt's family did not have
any. At the sincere request of my aunt, my sister was sent to my aunt's home and lived there. So I always
prayed a lot for her. She absolutely obeyed me, her immediate older brother. I thought I would do
anything to make her happy, but even that desire was cruelly crushed. Not only my little sister but also
my beloved little brother were taken away. We can learn from this that there is no mercy in the course of
indemnity. Still, I had to go through this course. (029-210, 1970/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My closest friends were all taken by the spirit world. Come to think of it now, the reason the spirit
world took all of them away was to prevent me from sharing my situation with them and developing
personal relationships with them. Had I done so, it would have hindered my carrying out the Will of God.
Thus, God took away all the people whom I cared about in the world. Knowing this very well, I could not
take any other path. I am not doing what I am doing because I am a fool. Wouldn't I have thought about
this over and over? (022-124, 1969/02/02)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="gods-call-through-jesus">God's call through Jesus</h3>
<p>Around the time True Father joined the Presbyterian Church, and while he was receiving a
modern education, his thinking grew wider and deeper. He began asking serious questions about
the present and future realities. Even as he faced many incomprehensible calamities in his own
family and clan, he witnessed the innumerable tragedies of his people under Japanese rule, and
personally experienced Korea's pain and sorrow as a weak nation. At the same time, Father
struggled to find the solution to the fundamental questions of human life.<br />
Father turned 16 (by Korean counting) shortly after he transferred to Jeongju Primary School.
Then, during Easter week, on April 17, 1935, while he was tearfully praying in the mountains at
dawn, he met Jesus, who shared with him many profound and amazing truths. The two of them
had more discussions over the following days. After True Father accepted his call from God, he
continued studying in his hometown, in Seoul, and abroad in Tokyo. During that time he went
through a period of preparation to deepen his faith and cultivate his sense of mission for his
future role as a providential figure.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My encounter with Jesus in the year I turned 16 was a profound spiritual experience. It was the first of
many revelations. After that special encounter, I have continued conversing with the living God and with
Jesus even until today. I also had conversations with the saints and sages in the spirit world. I cannot
describe in words all the things we shared. God chose me in accordance with His providential timetable.
(087-285, 1976)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was 16 years old when I had my first experience of actually knowing God. Before then I was merely
in the position of a humble seeker of truth. Ever since I entered boyhood I had been contemplating the
fundamental questions of human life: Who am I? Where did I come from? What is the purpose of life?
Will our life continue after we die? Does God really exist? Is God omnipotent or is He powerless? If God
is truly omnipotent, why does He not solve the problems of humanity? Why is there so much suffering on
this earth?<br />
For nine years following that first experience, I lived together with the omnipotent God and with Jesus. I
visited the spirit world on numerous occasions. Little by little, God revealed amazing truths to me. It felt
as if the morning sun was rising after a long night of darkness. In that truth I could see the dawning light
of a new, glorious culture. These special revelations, based on the New Testament, are higher than any
previous religious teachings. I felt that they had the power and ability to embrace all religions and unite
them. The revelations that I received are the core of what is now called the Principle. God has
commanded me to spread this Principle to the ends of the earth. (102-288, 1979/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot describe the seriousness of the position in which I stood when I was 16 years old. It was the
most difficult time for God, for Jesus, and for the churches that God had specially prepared for the Second
Coming. Korea was under the rule of Japan, and those churches were driven into a corner with nowhere to
run. At that moment God, heaven and earth, the five founders of the world's great religions and the
religious sphere all joined together around one point: the position of the Lord at the Second Advent. They
called me to take responsibility for that position, and I accepted the call. Once I accepted that position, my
own family and my country of Korea were also placed in a serious position. Hence I could not sleep at
night. I tried to eat, but I could not swallow. I could see everything clearly. Heaven and earth were about
to collapse, and the responsibility to save them was on my shoulders. Imagine how serious I had to be!
(554-257, 2007/02/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new revelations that I received explained God's Will very clearly. That Will is aimed at bringing
salvation to this world. The Unification Church is not just another denomination. The Unification Church
is leading the movement for the salvation of the world. Those who join this movement study God's Word,
by which they clearly understand the concept of a God-centered individual, a God-centered family, a
God-centered nation and a God-centered world. (087-285, 1976)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam and Eve fell when they were 16 years old. God was only able to raise them until the age of 16,
relating with them by a bond based on their inner heart and original nature. In my case, God chose me at
the age of 16 years and specially raised me so that I would be able to begin uniting the spiritual world and
the physical world that had been separated as a result of the Fall. Ever since the age of 16, I have grown
up connecting to God's original heart. That is why Satan and his world must follow me. Satan, who has
been ruling human beings from the positions of older son, father and grandfather, also governs from the
position of the nation, which rules over the realm of religion. Such is Satan's sovereignty. In human
history to this day there has never been a time when this order could be reversed. Nations always have
been in the front, leading religions. In other words, nations have been dragging religions around.
However, I am now reversing this order. I have been engrafted to the work of God ever since I was 16
years old, when I began to discover the secrets of heaven, of Satan and of human history. (493-229,
2005/04/25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time after time I came up against dark obstacles. Whenever that happened, I remembered God's voice
when He told me, "I am alive." You would not know that His voice remains in the marrow of my bones to
this day. I have not forgotten God's sorrowful situation, which He shared with me when He called me. I
cannot forget God's plea to me, "You need to focus only on your relationship with Me; you must not
forsake Me." Sometimes I feel sorry for my own situation, but then I remember that God's situation is
more sorrowful than mine. So, although you should feel indignation over history, you must experience
even more the aching heart of our Father, who has been enduring unbearable sorrow. Don't you think you
need to do that? You must, and then you can actually become His filial sons and daughters. Afterward
you should stand up and boldly proclaim, "Father, because I understood Your heart, I have become a
better son or daughter than any filial son or daughter in the world."<br />
I have fought for this, and I will continue doing so. I urge you to do the same. Then, from now on, it will
not matter if this or that religious body opposes the Unification Church and makes false accusations
against me. No matter how much they try to suppress me and the church with all their power and
authority, they will not be able to destroy the foundation we have established. (028-296, 1970/02/11)</p>

<h2 id="section-3-school-days">Section 3. School Days</h2>
<h3 id="primary-schools">Primary schools</h3>
<p>From the age of seven to 13 True Father studied at the village school. There he learned Chinese
characters and read the Confucian Classics. His memory was excellent, and his calligraphy was
so superb that his teacher used the characters he wrote as models for other students to copy. At
that time, his dream was to acquire at least three doctoral degrees, and for this he knew he
needed a broader education. So he enrolled at the Won-bong Preparatory School to prepare for
the entrance examination for a primary school with a modern curriculum. In 1934 he entered the
third grade at Osan Primary School. In April 1935 he transferred to the 4th grade at Jeongju
Public Primary School, mainly in order to study Japanese.</p>
<p>On March 25, 1938, at the graduation ceremony for the school's 29th class, he volunteered to
speak at the podium. Although the ceremony was nearing its end, he gave a long speech to
express his views in front of all the people who were gathered there. One by one he pointed out
the wrongs of Japanese colonial educational policy and its hypocrisy. He also pointed out the
problems of each individual teacher. Because of this incident, the Japanese police added his
name to their list as a person to be watched.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am also talented in drawing; I am good at it. In the village school that taught Chinese characters,
classics and calligraphy, there were people of many age groups -- from nine and ten-year-olds to grown-
ups in their twenties and thirties. To improve our skill at writing we practiced writing Chinese characters
every day. The teacher used the characters I wrote as models for other students to follow and copy. This
was before I was even 12. The other students would practice by copying my characters over and over,
hundreds of times.<br />
When they had done it so many times that it became a habit, I could tell that they had reached a new level.
I could see by glancing at the character which direction to move my calligraphy brush -- where to place
the top of the first stroke and where to end the last stroke. It did not matter how lengthy the phrase; I
could write it with ease. My skill was at a different level than that of others.<br />
After studying at the village school, I joined a small private school that specialized in teaching art. There
for the first time in my life I learned how to draw and paint pictures. The adults drew pictures on a special
drawing paper. As I stood in front of that paper, I contemplated what flowers I was going to draw.
Looking at the size of the paper, I calculated their sizes and locations in my mind. With this plan in mind
I made a rough sketch of the flowers, the images forming from the simple lines I drew. Next I completed
the coloring, and there it was, my first picture. They hung that picture on the wall at the school. (349-056,
2001/07/14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The village school where I went when I was young required us to finish one page a day from the book
that we were studying. But it did not take me even 30 minutes to do it. Once I focused, I memorized its
entire content within 30 minutes. Then I would recite it from memory in front of my teacher. So having
finished the day's lesson, I would go up to the mountain while the teacher was taking his afternoon nap.
Since teaching was so difficult at his age, he often took afternoon naps. On the mountain I would study
where the frogs were, where the bird nests were, where the coyotes were, where the mushrooms were
growing, and so on. I would explore everywhere. No wonder my mother was never able to find me. (204-
249, 1990/07/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I reached the age of ten, I was sent to a school called a geulbang, meaning "a room for learning
Chinese characters," that was in my village. This was because any member of the Moon clan who studied
in a distant location ended up dying far from home. Even from a providential perspective we understand
that for the sake of God's Will, second sons face great difficulties in their lives. Thus it was that a notion
circulated in the Moon clan that any second son who is sent to school away from home will die away
from home. That is why I was not allowed to travel and go to a public school but instead had to attend a
local village school.<br />
My whole life has been about pioneering and transformation, and this is where it began. While I was
attending the village school, God called me and I came to know His Will. As I began to think about the
path I was destined to walk, I realized that I should not be cooped up inside a village school. I clearly
understood that I was living in an age when a new scientific civilization was expanding. Airplanes were
flying in the sky, trains were traveling overland, and I was supposed to prepare myself to lead humanity
into a new future. I thought to myself, "I cannot just stay here in a village school." That was the point
where a transformation began in my life. So I went to a preparatory school and then entered primary
school. Back then, that school was called the Osan Primary School. I took the transfer test and entered the
third grade. I studied there for one year. During that time, I concentrated on studying hard. (211-133,
1990/12/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Osan Primary School did not allow students to speak Japanese. As you may have heard, it was the
school founded by Lee Seung-hoon, a prominent figure in Korean society who fought hard against the
Japanese and whom they regarded as their enemy. He was also one of the 33 people who led the Mansei
Demonstrations for Korean independence. Due to that background, the tradition of the Osan School was
that students were not allowed to speak Japanese. However, I believed that we must know our enemies. I
thought that we cannot devise a proper strategy to defeat our enemies if we do not know about them in
detail. That is why I took another test and transferred to the Jeongju Primary School as a 4th grader. By
the time I graduated, I had learned to speak fluent Japanese. All along the way I was deeply
contemplating the difficult issues in my life of faith and other fundamental questions about life. (211-133,
1990/12/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I transferred to the Jeongju Primary School, I learned Japanese. It feels as if it were yesterday that
I studied katakana and hiragana, the Japanese syllabaries. I memorized all of them in just one night. I had
to, because in that school the 3rd-, 4th- and 5th-graders all conversed in Japanese. Even though I was a lot
taller than most of the students, having entered the school at an older age, I was unable to speak even a
single word of Japanese.<br />
I felt ashamed, as if I were just a spectator in their midst, watching them having fun, dancing and singing,
but not knowing what to do to be part of their group. You cannot understand how embarrassed and
uncomfortable I was unless you have experienced it yourself. So in 15 days I memorized all the books
that the students in first, second, third and fourth grades were studying. Then my ears were opened, and I
could at least comprehend what they were talking about. (171-258, 1988/01/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was born with a pretty good brain. I am sure that I could have become a renowned scholar in any field
I chose to pursue. But I began to question seriously: What good is it to study hard and become a world-
renowned scholar? If I become a famous scholar, my life will inevitably take a predictable course: I will
study and teach my students in front of a blackboard, breathing in chalk dust and holding a stub of chalk
in my hand until my bones creak from old age and I eventually die. Living that sort of life, will I resolve
the ultimate problems of the world? Absolutely not. I asked myself, "What is the most difficult path a
human being can choose?" I wanted to walk the most difficult path possible, or the one that everyone
thinks is the hardest. I thought of accomplishing something that no one in history -- past, present or future
-- has been able to accomplish. (090-044, 1976/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I studied, I studied like lightning. In no time I finished materials that would take years for an
ordinary person. My hometown is a small farming village located eight kilometers northeast of Jeongju. It
seems like just yesterday that I was studying there, at night under a kerosene lamp. When I stayed up at
night studying until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., my mother and father would tell me, "Go to bed, or you will lose
your strength!" This happened all the time at home. I made friends with the insects that came out at night.
Especially in summer I made many such friends as I sat still and studied until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.
Nighttime in the countryside is very tranquil. The sounds of the insects on such moonlit nights are simply
mesmerizing. (100-160, 1978/10/09)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="study-in-seoul">Study in Seoul</h3>
<p>After graduating from Jeongju Public Primary School, True Father went to Seoul. From April 12,
1938 to March 8, 1941 he attended the Gyeongseong School of Commerce and Industry, located
in Heukseok-dong. He made sure he was always the first to arrive at school in the morning, and
he often took responsibility to clean his classroom by himself. Because he was so exemplary, his
classmates could not treat him lightly but afforded him respect. He protected the weak and did
not hesitate to confront arrogant and strong bullies in order to teach them right from wrong.</p>
<p>Although he had an active personality, Father rarely spoke, being serious and sincere. In order to
find the way to heaven and cultivate his character, he was silent much of the time. His report card
records that he was "cheerful, active, sincere and serious, strong, healthy-minded, volunteers to
do things, and hard-working." It further states, "He is physically fit and strong, has a good
attendance record, and likes soccer."</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Those who are humble are elevated. In school, there are students who just use their fists to bully others
without knowing where they stand or what their situations are. However, there are also humble students
who, even though they are superior in every way, are not arrogant. When you look at such people you feel
small, without knowing why. They have an air of authority and dignity, and although you feel you want to
approach them, you sense a certain awe for no reason. You may have known people like that among your
friends. I hardly spoke during my student years. I never engaged in idle conversations with other students.
There were days I did not utter even one word. This is why my classmates treated me with respect. To
them, I was more difficult to approach than the teachers. I do not mean I threatened them or used violence
of any kind. Yet they did not relate to me casually. Also, whenever they had personal problems they came
to me and discussed them with me. (037-130, 1970/12/23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My school friends regarded me with a certain awe. Whenever my classmates got together they would
do all sorts of things to have fun among themselves, but they could not do it with me. I never engaged in
their idle games, yet many times I discreetly helped classmates who were in difficult situations. I was
athletic. I was good at wrestling and soccer. I was also good at pull-ups. My body was big but I was very
agile. When I moved to Heukseok-dong, within a week I met all the neighborhood gang leaders and found
out who was the boss. But my thinking was that I should be the one to teach them what it means to be a
real boss. (2010/01/28)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was going to middle school, I used to clean the school by myself. I wanted to be number one
in loving my school; and with the heart to represent all the students I cleaned the school. When I first
began cleaning my friends helped me, but I did not like their help; I wanted to do it alone. I wanted to
make the school really clean, so I often ended up cleaning again the places my friends had already
cleaned. After this happened a few times, my friends entrusted me with the entire task. So I naturally
ended up doing it alone. (133-182, 1984/07/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once I start doing something, I never just let it go. I was like that even when I was young. I never
believed anything until I verified it myself, whether in the village or at the school. When a teacher taught
me a mathematical formula, I pressured him by asking, "Why is the formula like this?" I investigated it,
examined it and dug into it again and again. Doing something only approximately is not my way. Doing
things by half measures never works. (162-277, 1987/04/17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During my student days I had a way of knowing ahead of time the questions that would be asked on
the examination. When the teacher lectured, I paid attention to how serious he or she was in making the
points. I identified the teacher's favorite student by the way he or she looked the student straight in the eye
as he sat in the corner of the classroom. I paid attention to which student the teacher was looking at, and
then marked the topics with codes, "A, B, C," etc., according to how much the teacher emphasized the
topic and how intently he looked at the good student while speaking of it. As long as I studied the
contents that I had marked with the codes, I never failed the examination. I would correctly anticipate
about 30 to 40 percent of the questions on the test, and I would study for them more than the other
materials. I could do that because I was very attentive to the teachers in my classes. (2009/11/17)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lifestyle-and-prayer">Lifestyle and prayer</h3>
<p>During the almost three years that he attended school in Seoul, True Father engaged in rigorous
self-discipline. He lived independently and also at a boarding house where meals were provided.
To cultivate his life of faith he engaged in near constant penance and various other activities, all
the while keeping up his studies at school. In the beginning and for some time he commuted to his
school from Noryangjin, in the Dongjak district. Mostly he lived in Heukseok-dong, first living
independently and then for a time at a boarding house. His family sent him sufficient money for
his tuition and living expenses, but he slept in a cold, unheated room. In the bitter cold of winter
he cooked his food with icy cold water that he drew from a well. It was so cold that sometimes the
chain on the bucket in the well stuck to his hands. He voluntarily lived this way because he
wanted to personally experience the situation of those who live in hardship.</p>
<p>From that time on, Father fasted during lunch every day. Morning and evening his food was
always the same, a meal consisting of one bowl of rice and a side dish. He willingly went hungry
because that way he could feel closer to God's heart. Also, he prayed more than 12 hours a day.
His long and fervent prayers gave him calluses on his knees and elbows. Most notably he had
serious, desperate showdown prayers in the pine forest near his school, at a rock on the side of
Mt. Seodal behind a church, or at the foot of that mountain on the Dongjak district side. Through
these prayers, he experienced God's heart and made oneness with Him in heart.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I was living alone and studying at school in Seoul, one winter was particularly cold. The
average temperature was around minus 17 to minus 21 degrees Celsius (about 0 to minus 5 degrees
Fahrenheit). The weather was that cold. During December and January of that cold winter, I lived in a
cold room and I cooked for myself with icy cold water. I had an experience that I cannot forget: I used to
draw really pure and tasty water from a well on a mountain ridge. That well was more than ten feet deep;
it had a bucket attached to a chain, not to a rope that could be easily cut. It was so cold that when I
grasped the chain my hands stuck to it, and I had to blow my hands to warm them enough to get them
free. That feels like yesterday. Those were my circumstances when I began living independently from my
family. (139-050, 1986/01/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanted to do everything necessary to live by myself without having to depend on women. Since I
had made the fulfillment of the Will my lifetime quest, I was determined to do it even if I had to live as a
single man. Therefore, I learned how to take care of myself. That is why I can do everything myself. I can
handle whatever I need for my life without being indebted to others. That is why I can cook rice well on a
wood or charcoal fire. When it comes to cooking, I can quickly tell if people are amateurs by observing
their cutting skills. I can also tell if they are good at cooking by observing the way they prepare side
dishes. That is because during the more than seven years that I lived a single life, I prepared my own food
and everything else I needed.<br />
I do not need to eat many side dishes. Whenever I visit local churches, they make elaborate preparations
and serve many side dishes on the table. However, I do not like that. To me, a single side dish is enough if
it is something I like. By nature, I am the kind of person who likes to finish whatever I start. It is the same
when it comes to food. Although there may be many dishes on the table, usually I pick one that suits my
taste and finish it completely, although I also taste the others. (050-296, 1971/11/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future, anyone who wants to know the history of the Unification Church will have to visit
Heukseok-dong, this place where I lived as a young man. One day Heukseok-dong, which means
Blackstone neighborhood, will be transformed into Baekseok-dong, Whitestone neighborhood. This
pitch-dark valley where I lived long ago must become the base of a tradition that shines like sunlight to all
the people of the world. Nodeul Riverside Park used to be there too, but I cannot find any traces of it now.
Although today I cannot meet the people whom I knew when I lived in Heukseok-dong, they must have
produced many descendants who still live there. I would be so overwhelmed to meet those people, whose
parents or grandparents knew me in those days! I imagine what it would be like if that happened; we
could resurrect the history of that time. We would talk about that history and recall those past
relationships, and they would blossom anew in this era. (187-255, 1989/02/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was living in Heukseok-dong I had an experience that I still cannot forget. On the road to
Sangdo-dong there was a Japanese-style house with flowers growing next to a forest of pine trees. Behind
that house was a rice field, and beyond that there was a village. In that village was a home that I used to
visit when I was doing pioneer evangelizing.<br />
One day I saw a sick stranger lying on that road. I had never met him before. It must have been around the
end of March, since the new semester had just started, and I was carrying with me the money for my
school tuition and other expenses. This pitiful man had no son, but he said he had a daughter living in
Cheonan. So I gave him all my money so that he could travel to her place and get medical treatment. He
must have had good ancestors, because the moment I saw him I could not just continue on my way and
turn my back on him. That is why I gave him all the money in my wallet, including the money for my
textbooks and the rent money for my boarding house. Moreover, I carried him on my back for about three
kilometers. I still vividly remember this; it is as if it happened the day before yesterday.<br />
When heaven leads you to meet someone, you should love that person more than heaven expects you to.
Then you will never suffer damage. For example, if heaven asks you to give 10 but instead you give 1 00
instead, 90 will be considered your offering for the public purpose before heaven. On the other hand, you
should never give 5 when heaven hopes you will give 10. When heaven hopes you will give 10, you
should give more than 10. If you give less than heaven hoped you would, God's grace will be blocked
from reaching your path. This is a law. It is a formula of the Principle. (056-039, 1972/05/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In those days I was hungry every day. It was not from lack of money. Early in April my parents would
send me money for my tuition, but by May it was gone. I would give it all to people who were poor and
destitute. I have many stories about this. How, then, did I cover my tuition? I delivered newspapers, sold
things and did various odd jobs. I needed to take the path of indemnity. When I first moved to Seoul from
my hometown in Pyeongan Province, I was not used to the language and customs there. I missed my
hometown very much, particularly during my first school vacation. You cannot imagine how much my
mother loved me. But after I came to know God's Will, I had to separate from her. I also had to distance
myself from my sisters who loved me dearly.<br />
I had to take the opposite way from what my mother and father expected me to do, from their point of
view. That is why on the first day of the vacation, when my neighborhood and school were hustling and
bustling with students preparing to return to their hometowns, I closed the door and locked myself in my
room. I spent the first day of my vacation thinking, "I have many things to do before my friends come
back." (187-250, 1989/02/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All people desire to have mastery over the universe, but they cannot even master themselves. That is
why I declare, "Before you desire to rule over the universe, you must first rule over yourself." Self-control
begins with the desire for food. You can master the desire to eat by fasting. A one-week fast should be no
problem. You must go through training that would bring an ordinary person to the brink of death. You
must overcome hunger. When I was living independently as a student, Korea was under Japanese
occupation, and rice was scarce. My friends fought over who would take the largest portion of rice from
the pot, but not I. The person who puts down his spoon first is the master of those who put it down later.
That is a rule and a principle. My life is renewed every day. Tomorrow must be better than today. I
believe heaven wants something new from me, and that is what I put into practice. Because I did this, I
could reach the worldwide level, something no one has ever been able to do. (249-204, 1993/10/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the years I was growing up in Seoul, I did not eat lunch. I thought, "As long as we don't have
an independent nation, how can I be worthy to eat three meals a day?" I missed meals many times in my
life, but I missed my people more than food. This is the path I chose. I continually resolved, "I will love
my people and my country more than food." So after I left my hometown and moved to Seoul I did not
eat lunch. Such was the life I led. It was not because I could not afford to buy lunch. It was because
whenever I had money I gave it to the poor. (049-074, 1971/10/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not sleep more than four hours a day. I trained myself until it became my habit. When I am busy,
I can go with only one hour of sleep daily. I think I am the person who has slept the fewest hours of
anyone in history. I lived my whole life that way. Also, there is no one who has been hungrier than me. I
had food to eat, but I could hear the cries of hungry people wishing to be fed. That is why I could not eat
three meals a day. Until I became 30 years old I practiced a discipline of having only two meals a day,
skipping lunch. I spent my youth eating less than two bowls a day, even though I was healthy and big
enough to digest five bowls a day. I trained myself to love people more than I loved food, and I strove to
make my life a tower of loving God and loving my nation. (197-163, 1990/01/13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherever I was, I always prayed in tears. People who happened to see me in tears felt sympathy for
me without knowing why. Wherever I went, many people treated me as well as you do. For example, my
landlady would bring me some of the food she had prepared for her husband or for a holiday celebration,
food she had prepared all through the night without sleeping. She could not go into her room otherwise.
She told me that whenever she went into her room without first bringing me food, suddenly everything
turned to darkness and she could not see anything. She did not know why that happened.<br />
When women prepared food with sincerity, God wanted them to give it to me and moved their hearts to
do so. Many such spiritual events took place. That is why I can never forget God's love for me, not even
for one moment. I can never forget God's love, even if my body is crushed to pieces and my bones are
turned into powder thousands upon thousands of times. Throughout my life God was with me wherever I
was, and He toiled so hard for me. (022-122, 1969/02/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you pray, you need to pray to the extent that your back becomes bent and the skin of your knees
becomes callused. My knees are still callused from my prayers in the olden days. You should pray on a
wooden floor. And you should shed tears when you pray. I experienced several occasions when I prayed
so tearfully and for such a long time that the floor became soaked with tears and still had not dried out by
the next prayer time. I am not a man who will just drift away. (025-334, 1969/10/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The path of restoration is never easy. Do you think I could ever feel at ease if I ate and slept as you
do? The Principle itself is so serious. My knees are callused from countless prayers. I do not know how
many tears I shed. I knew people were dying every day with the fundamental problems of their lives
unresolved. Therefore, my eyes were always swollen and red with tears as I tried to find solutions for
them. Sometimes I shed so many tears in prayer that when I opened my eyes I could not see the sunlight.
Yet this was how I had to seek for the path. (143-331, 1986/03/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should pray every day. Even your prayer life should be a tithe. That means you should pray two
hours and 24 minutes every day -- one tenth of each day. When my prayer life was at its peak, I prayed 17
to 18 hours per day. I usually prayed for 12 hours straight, bending down on my hands and knees. I never
ate lunch. In my prayers I wept bitterly. Without such prayers, I could not live. Every direction was
blocked, and there was no hole through which to escape. Only when I prayed could I see a pinhole of
light. Passing through these ordeals I discovered the Principle. Did you ever weep while holding the
Divine Principle book? Have you ever been that serious? Your lifetime is precious. Once your life is
gone, it will never return. Usually people marry and give birth to children; then they end up finishing their
life while struggling with all kinds of burdens. It is a serious problem. If this pattern continues, we can
never bring about the world of goodness. (199-190, 1990/02/16)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-myeongsudae-church">The Myeongsudae church</h3>
<p>During the time True Father was living in Heukseok-dong, Seoul, he stood against the self-
righteous churches that were administered under the system of Japanese rule. He opposed their
way of doctrine-based faith. Instead he connected to the Pentecostal church that was leading the
movement of the Holy Spirit in Korea. After attending that church in Seobinggo, he played a
pivotal role in founding the Myeongsudae New Jesus Church in Heukseok-dong in the autumn of
1939.</p>
<p>Rev. Lee Ho-bin and Rev. Pak Jae-bong from the Pyongyang New Jesus Church frequently visited
the New Jesus Church in Heukseok-dong and held revivals and Bible study classes. Whenever
they visited, True Father attended them and deepened his relationship with them. True Father
taught the students at the Sunday school, giving them his special love. Further, whenever he went
to Pyongyang during summer vacation, he spoke to the Sunday school students at the Pyongyang
New Jesus Church.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While attending school, I taught the students who went to the Myeongsudae Church in Heukseok-
dong; I also did the same at the Seobinggo Church. At that time it was very cold, and at night as we
crossed the frozen Han River we could hear the plates of ice cracking. It was a frightening sound to hear
when I was on the river all alone. Nevertheless, I would cross the Han River in order to teach the Sunday
School students of Seobinggo Church. I taught them about the Bible with much animation, so that it
would be interesting. I even shed tears. I thought that the students might not like to see me crying, and
that they might ask me to stop teaching them. Yet they did not want me to stop; instead, they followed me
around and begged me to teach them more. (187-307, 1989/02/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was a student, three of my friends and I started the Myeongsudae New Jesus Church in
Heukseok-dong. I invested every penny of my tuition. There is still a trace of that church even now. I
remember my evangelizing activities to bring many people to that church, before a new church opened in
Seobinggo. At the peak of winter the Han River was frozen over, and the cracking sound of its ice was
loud and terrifying. I have many memories about what I did during that period of Korean history, so filled
with bitter sorrows. (543-331, 2006/11/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am someone who has offered bows even to very small children. I have attended three-year-old
children with utmost sincerity, as if they were princes and princesses of heaven. I speak to you now only
after having made internally and externally a victorious foundation that will be attested to throughout
history. Part of that foundation was to win the hearts of children. I had to win the hearts of people from
three generations, representing the past, present and future. I had to establish that tradition. I taught the
Sunday school students who came to the Myeongsudae New Jesus Church, loving them sincerely and
regarding them as the hope of my life. Some of them wanted to skip school and follow me around; this is
because my mission was to pioneer the work of loving Cain. (060-200, 1972/08/17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key leaders at the New Jesus Church in Pyongyang were Rev. Lee Ho-bin, Rev. Pak Jae-bong,
and Rev. Han Jun-myeong. That church had a large membership, including several thousand students. It
was a beautiful building and was well known. Whenever I came up to Pyongyang and visited that church,
I was always welcome to take charge of teaching the students there. I was recognized as a good Sunday
School teacher. I knew all the pastors and was popular among the students, so everyone wanted to invite
me to their home. (441-271, 2004/03/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am well aware of the secrets of Rev. Lee Ho-bin, Rev. Han Jun-myeong and Rev. Pak Jae-bong of
the New Jesus Church in Pyongyang. When I admonished them about their calling and their responsibility
for God's Will, they could not answer me. I advised them not to do certain things that they were involved
with. Hence, they feared me more than anyone. I knew all the hidden truths of the Old and New
Testaments even as a high school student. In my visits to the church I became such a famous student
leader that its thousands of Sunday school students asked me to give sermons. They were mesmerized by
my words. When I left, they made such a crowd at the railroad station that the pastors arrived and formed
a line in order to protect me. Therefore, the three pastors always listened to my advice. (463-059,

<h2 id="section-4-study-in-japan">Section 4. Study in Japan</h2>
<h3 id="first-days-in-japan">First days in Japan</h3>
<p>To broaden and deepen himself in preparation for his mission, True Father went to study in
Japan. On March 31, 1941, he departed from Seoul Station and took the Hikari line train to
Busan. On April 1, he sailed to Japan on the Shokei Maru, a liner operating between the port of
Busan and Shimonoseki. At the beginning of April, Father enrolled in the Waseda Technical High
School, which was attached to Waseda University, and began his studies in electrical
engineering.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From childhood I held the thought, "If my country (Korea) were stronger than Japan, its fate would
have been different." This was its problem. I felt deeply that my country's weakness, especially the
weakness of its external foundation, was the reason it could not avoid a miserable fate. Studying the
countries of the world, I learned that the most powerful country in the world at the time was the United
States. As a child I already knew that. I further thought, "The United States is a much larger and more
powerful country than Japan, but it's just the same there. Doesn't it also try to take advantage of weak
nations for its own benefit? Is there any righteous country anywhere which, as the representative nation of
the world, protects and lifts up weak countries? If there were such a country, what would it look like?"<br />
As a child, I thought that what had been historically impossible for human beings would be possible for
the Creator. I thought that if He truly existed, He could do it. Therefore I resolved, "If the Creator, the
Absolute Being, exists, I will partner with Him to do the work of saving my country and liberating its
oppressed people." But first I needed an answer regarding the existence of God. For this I searched within
religions. I thought that if God really exists, then I must find a way to meet Him. As I was passing
through my teens and approaching my twenties, I agonized over many issues on my journey of faith. I
thought, "I have to go to Japan and then to the United States. I need to experience sorrow and persecution
there as a representative of a people whose power is smaller and weaker." (199-213, 1990/02/17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I began my journey to Japan and was crossing the Han River Bridge, I shed many tears. I felt as if I
were leaving the Korean people behind, like orphans. It seems it was only the day before yesterday when
those tears poured down my face. On the train to Busan I wept bitterly all the way while covering my
head with my coat. A Japanese woman saw me crying and said, "Young man, did your father or mother
die? Everyone goes through that kind of sorrow." She tried to comfort me, but my sorrow was something
that sprang from a heart completely filled with love for my country. I tell you, people who cannot love
their country cannot truly love heaven. (039-062, 1971/01/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On my way to Japan I traveled from Seoul to Busan on the Hikari line train. While riding that train I
asked myself, "What is it that I should learn in Japan?" Then I resolved, "I will liberate my country, and I
will pave the way for the next generation to have hope and to prosper in an independent nation." I still
remember shedding tears as I held on to a handrail while crossing the Han River. At that moment I
resolved, "By the time I return, I will no longer be shedding tears." (199-185, 1990/02/16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Busan I boarded a ship bound for Japan. I still remember vividly how I continuously shed tears on
the way. As Korea was under Japanese rule, I thought, "Who will liberate this poor nation from its
shackles?" I gazed at the stars throughout the night and longed for the day of my country's and my
people's liberation. I tearfully prayed to God, "Now I am departing my country. Oh God! Please protect
my country until I return." That time is still fresh in my memory, as if it happened yesterday. (039-062,
1971/01/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I attended evening classes at the technical school at Waseda University so that during the daytime I
could work as a laborer to help other Korean students pay their tuition. You do not know all the
difficulties I went through in Japan. Japanese people who are now alive must appeal with tears for their
nation to be forgiven. Otherwise Japan cannot stand. Japanese people need to apologize for the shameful
way they treated Korea and the other nations of Asia. (590-145, 2008/05/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had many Japanese friends when I was living in Japan. I treated them with utmost respect. Whenever
they were in difficult situations, they came to see me to discuss their problems. Sometimes they asked out
of concern, "How is Korea doing?" I did not want to be outdone by any of my Japanese friends. So when
they spoke one word, I spoke two words. I generally speak very fast, but when I spoke with Japanese
people I spoke even faster. I studied how to speak fast and trained myself to do so. I resolved I would
someday lead Japanese youth and mobilize them for the sake of the world. So I practiced to gain the
ability to discuss issues better than Japanese people could, by gaining deeper and broader knowledge in
all fields. (205-069, 1990/07/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my childhood I used to speak slowly. However, after coming to Japan, as I was learning to speak
better Japanese every day, I competed with Japanese people to see who could say more in one minute. If I
was ever defeated I could not fall asleep, so I trained myself to speak even more rapidly. If in 30 minutes
I could say 1,000 words speaking normally, by speaking faster I could say more than 2,000 words. When
learning a language it is important to train yourself through practice. (055-056, 1972/04/23)</p>

<h3 id="mind-body-discipline">Mind-body discipline</h3>
<p>During the time he studied in Japan, True Father immersed himself in the task of researching and
systematizing the Principle. He repeatedly pored over the Bible and compared it with the
Principle that he had newly discovered, in order to verify it with the Scripture. Bibles in Korean,
Japanese and English were always on his desk at the boarding house. The Korean and Japanese
Bibles, especially, were so full of underlining in different colors that people could barely read the
words on the pages. The process of finding and systematizing the vast and fundamental truth was
a lonely path; there was no one to guide him through it.</p>
<p>Besides his academic studies, True Father pushed himself hard to have many different life
experiences, among the working class, the middle class and the upper class. In order to prepare
himself for his revolutionary mission, he tried to break through every limitation and accumulate
abilities to deal with any circumstance that might arise on his way to the final destination. When
he received money from home for his school and living expenses, he used it to help those in need;
then he went out to do the work of a laborer. Among many other things, he carried an A-frame on
his back and pulled a delivery cart. Shedding blood and sweat, he became a friend and brother to
his fellow laborers, sharing their pain and their joy. Through training himself in this way, he
personally experienced the teaching, "The one who would become a glorious king must be
victorious over all kinds of pain."</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I did not reveal my thoughts about my mission to others. Even my friends did not know. I studied the
Bible and read books on religion and philosophy, which ordinary people usually did not do. One of my
friends majored in politics and economics at Waseda University. He was studying communism, and this
led to a fierce debate between us. I once delivered a loud, impassioned speech on the side of the road. I
did this where many people had gathered to view the cherry blossoms. I spoke strongly on the issues of
the time, and urged the youth to act this way and that for the sake of the future. The predictions I made
then are now coming true. Some of my friends happened to join the crowd; they were quite astonished
when they saw it was I who was giving the speech. (015-182, 1965/10/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving a recommendation from my school in Seoul, I entered Waseda Technical High School.
But I studied books about religion more than school-related subjects. I studied the Bible carefully to
uncover its hidden truths. There was one particular Bible page I could not understand even after
struggling for five years. That one page contained the root problem of human history. I had to completely
and clearly solve the most difficult and complex issues in the Bible. This is how the Principle came to
emerge into the world. Since, together with heaven, I unraveled the truth, heaven cannot ignore this.
Heaven knows all about it. (571-190, 2007/08/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before I turned 20 years of age, I went through a course of bloody tears. I knew I could not enter
God's realm of heart unless I had the heart to be friends with beggars and love them as if they were my
own older brother or my own mother. So I lived with the heart to love everyone. I trained myself the same
way in Japan, but this time with a heart to go beyond the nation. I helped my friends pay their tuition by
making money as a laborer at a construction site. You too should walk such a path. Why did I do it? I
volunteered to travel the most difficult path because I knew God's path has been even more difficult.
(137-286, 1986/01/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On days when it snowed or when typhoon winds raged, I went to work at a construction site rather
than going to school. It felt good to challenge such harsh weather. Rain from the typhoon would wash the
dirt and soot from my hands. Amid the storm I worked hard and sweated copiously. I felt so refreshed
from it. When I saw a person behaving badly, I scolded him. Sometimes I had to deal with people who
were bigger than me, but I defeated them. When a foreman exploited the laborers by taking 30 percent of
their wages, I strongly protested. Most people feared the man, but I was not submissive; I admonished
him to stop. In the end he surrendered to me. (015-181, 1965/10/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was in Tokyo I worked pulling a cart as a deliveryman, making deliveries in 27 different
districts. I decided to do the job not because I needed the money but because I wanted the training. If you
find yourself working in a transportation company, you should become more knowledgeable about the
work than the company veterans. If not, how can you persuade them to take you seriously? During the
summer I transported telephone poles on a cart. Once there was an incident: As I came to an intersection,
a pole shifted to one side, causing my cart to spin around. Sensing danger, all the passersby, men and
women, scattered. I can still picture it in my mind. I have another unforgettable memory, about when I
lived in a slum. I covered myself with a ragged blanket, and my clothes became infested with lice. I am
God's Son, but I volunteered to become a frontline soldier, a guerrilla of sorts, in order to conquer Satan's
world. (199-174, 1990/02/16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The times in Japan when I worked at a construction site and pulled a cart in Ginza remain vivid
memories. I did not do that work just to make a living. I did it to set the example of how young people
should go through difficulties. I had friends who had stopped going to school. I wanted to help them
graduate, so I withdrew from school for several months and took on the role of their parents. I had no time
to sleep at night. I woke up as early as two in the morning and went out to work to make money for their
tuition. Why did I do that? It was not because I was not as smart as them. It was to serve them. For this I
did all kinds of work, including working for a company, selling my calligraphy and working as a
foreman. (026-069, 1969/10/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am very knowledgeable about the world. When I was young I traveled to every corner of Korea. I
visited many places in Japan when I was studying there. I also did all sorts of work. I was an errand-boy
for a large company. No matter how I was mistreated, I did not complain. People regarded me as nothing
but a student from abroad, but they did not know what was in my mind. I did not even mind living in a
slum. After all, we must train ourselves to have real ability to deal with any situation and bring good
results in whatever we do. (189-299, 1989/06/17)</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="the-path-of-true-love">The path of true love</h3>
<p>During his time of study in Japan, True Father practiced his own motto, "Before you desire
dominion over the universe, first have dominion over yourself." He trained himself repeatedly in
order to control his five senses. Among other things, he trained himself not to be ticklish and to
look away from temptation. In order to live for heaven's heart rather than follow a selfish human
heart, he constantly reminded himself, "I must love the Japanese people more than I love my own
people." He trained himself to sincerely love the people of what was then an enemy nation as if
they were his own parents or his own older brother.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I was young and preparing for my mission, I would not even go near a movie theater. Until I
could achieve total self-control, I did not walk in front of a bar. Unless we gain total control over
ourselves, we are bound to fail in whatever we do. What is the most difficult obstacle to achieving self-
control? It is sleep. Hunger is next. After that is sexual desire. These are the three enemies. Therefore, as a
course of training I purposely did not sleep, I did not eat, and I lived a life of purity. Until we have
dominion over ourselves, we cannot have dominion over the universe. Only after we govern ourselves can
we govern the universe. We are not entitled to call on God for help or hope to enter the realm of God's
dominion unless we first achieve mastery over ourselves. This is the view of the Principle. Adam fell
because he did not have self-control. (131-322, 1984/05/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was in wartime Japan, I walked around the back alleys in the red light district of Shinjuku,
Tokyo. I observed people and listened to them wherever I went in order to gain something helpful for my
mission. If we are ready to deal with even the most evil places, we can digest anything. This is my
philosophy. I am not the kind of person who goes around looking for an easy or comfortable environment.
The idea that in order to cultivate the mind you must go to the deep mountains or to a quiet and
magnificent place makes no sense to me. Studying only in tranquil places does not work for me. I could
study well even in noisy factories where high-powered engines and motors were running. I trained myself
in many different ways. Once, when a group of strong men were harassing a weaker man, I fought and
defeated them singlehandedly. I did not do it for recognition. It was a matter of my philosophy, of what is
necessary in life. (015-131, 1965/10/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My hope is greater than yours; it is as high as a great mountain. However, because I knew that the
time was coming when I would have to push many people to travel the road of a servant, I first pushed
myself to take the position of a servant. Had I not lived the life of a servant myself, I would not be
qualified to call others to do it. If I wanted others to live the life of a servant, I needed to live the life of a
servant first. I had to become a servant for the sake of my country of Korea. This is why I once became a
servant of three-year-old children and served them faithfully morning and evening. I attended those
children as if each were God. Also, when I was studying in Japan, I lived in a slum swarming with lice. I
carried loads of coal and loads of salt. I welcomed all kinds of experiences that others would shrink from.
This is my personal story, and some bitter sorrow remains. You should alleviate my bitter sorrow. What
then should be your starting point? What is it that you need to grab onto as the basis of your own
emotional resolve? It should be to represent me. When you go to those places, you should go on my
behalf. Although you may receive persecution, when you shed tears for the people there, you will feel my
blood throbbing in your veins. (025-212, 1969/10/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I studied the subject of what people will not do. For instance, people do not want to skip meals. So I
pondered, "Can I endure not eating?" And I said to myself, "Yes, I can." So I started training myself not
to eat. I was then so hungry that if anyone served me a meal I could have quickly devoured three or four
bowls of rice. One day I thought to myself, "Let me see how much I can eat." As it was the middle of a
war, we received ration coupons. Taking all my ration coupons, I took my friends to a restaurant and said,
"Let's eat as much as we can and see what our limit is." We wolfed down more and more. I ate seven
servings of rice covered with fried eggs and chicken. After seven servings I was so full I could not even
turn my neck around. It was more painful than being hungry.<br />
I gave myself that experience. However, you would be seriously mistaken if you think I did it all the time.
In fact, I was always hungry. Why do you think I made myself go hungry? If I only cared about keeping
my stomach full, how could I keep people with me and keep God with me? So although I was hungry and
wanted to eat, I resolved that I must love my people and God more than food. This was truth to me; it was
my creed. (015-183, 1965/10/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was a student in Tokyo, on rainy days while still wearing my student uniform I would
purposely mix with laborers who smelled from their dirty, wet clothes. I went to the places that smelled
the worst. Standing next to them, I thought, "What if these people were my older brother or my father? If
they were enduring these miserable conditions for me, what must I do for them?" When I rode the trolley
to school, I would look around at the students all well dressed in their uniforms and compare them to
those laborers. And I would think, "You are in the springtime of your life, all smiles and laughter, but in
time this will all disappear. However, my way of thinking leads to a life that will shine and rise up like the
sun to a hopeful future. My future is more or less assured, but your future is less certain."<br />
You must understand that upholding and living up to the name of True Parents throughout my entire life
has been extremely difficult. I had to cultivate such qualities in myself that people of every status, high or
low, could relate to me as their subject partner. (117-019, 1982/01/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During my time of studying in Japan, I would occasionally visit my home in Jeongju. I generally did
not send telegrams to my parents to tell them when I was coming. My home was about eight kilometers
from the train station, and I wanted to walk home. I enjoyed walking on cold, windy, snowy or rainy
days. As I prayed while walking down the road, I realized even more what a magnificent world we live in,
and I could not help but be amazed at the Maker who created it. I have unforgettable memories of nights
when I walked home after sunset, or nights when white snow was falling. Carrying small gifts for my
parents in both hands, I delighted in imagining the expressions they would have on their faces. Whenever
I think of it, I become nostalgic. I realize how blessed I was at that time in my life. (018-243, 1967/06/11)</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="graduation-and-return-to-korea">Graduation and return to Korea</h3>
<p>Due to a change of circumstances in Japan caused by the war, True Fathers study in Japan was
cut short by one semester. Hence he graduated earlier than expected, on September 30, 1943, in
the 25th graduating class of Waseda Technical School. After graduation True Father purchased
a ticket for an October 4 departure on the ship from Shimonoseki to Busan and sent his family a
telegram giving the date and time of his arrival in Busan. On the departure day, as he entered the
train station in Tokyo with his friends who were sending him off, he suddenly felt uneasy. He did
not know why, but it was as if his feet were weighed down and he could hardly drag himself onto
the train. So he decided to postpone his journey home.</p>
<p>The ship that departed that day, the one for which True Father had purchased a ticket, was called
the Gonnon Maru. On October 5 at 1:15 a.m., about ten nautical miles northeast of Oki-noshima,
the ship was sunk by an American torpedo. True Fathers family was in total shock when they
heard the news of the sinking. They had not heard that Father had changed his departure date. As
True Father was journeying back home in the middle of October, he made a solemn resolution:
This time I am coming home without having been able to dissolve the bitter sorrow of my people.
Yet in the near future the time will come when I will be able to teach Japanese youth and guide
them to do God's Will. Then we will meet again.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I graduated from my school in Japan, it was the middle of the Second World War. For military
reasons they graduated my class in September, six months earlier than normal. I sent a telegram to my
hometown informing my family of my arrival time on the ship from Shimonoseki to Busan. But in the
midst of the war that ship was sunk. Back in my hometown, my family checked the passenger list of that
ill-fated ship, but they could not find my name. Everyone thought I had died, which caused a great
commotion throughout my village. (015-147, 1965/10/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sinking of the Gonnon Maru was in 1943. I was scheduled to board that ship in order to return to
Korea from Japan. My graduation had been advanced by six months, and I bought a ticket from Tokyo to
Seoul that included passage on the ship, which was to depart from Shimonoseki. But as soon as I entered
the Tokyo train station to catch the train to Shimonoseki, I felt uneasy. So although I had already
purchased the ticket, I did not take that train. Shortly after purchasing my train ticket, I sent a telegram to
my family giving them the scheduled date and time of my arrival. Based on that schedule, my family in
my hometown expected that I would come home on a certain day and time. However, after I had my
premonition I left the Tokyo station and instead went with my friends who had come to send me off. I
believe we went to a place called Atami. Consequently, I did not board the ship that ended up sinking.<br />
In the meantime, since I did not come home, my family in my hometown, to whom I had sent the
telegram, thought I had died. My mother went nearly insane. She dropped everything and hurriedly
traveled to Busan to find me. It is 230 kilometers from Jeongju to Seoul; the journey took ten hours by
train. Then she took another train from Seoul to Busan. You can hardly imagine her mental and emotional
state during that journey. She did not even put on a dress; she ran out of the house only in her house
clothes, which are like pajamas. Her shoes came off as she ran to the train station nearest Jeongju, but she
did not notice; she did not even feel that an acacia tree thorn had embedded itself the sole in of her foot. A
callous hardened over it, and I heard that she did not pull it out until after I returned home. I then realized,
"Ah, this is the greatness of a parents love!" (125-310, 1983/03/29)</p>
