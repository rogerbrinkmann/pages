## Chapter 4 True Mother's Childhood and Youth

### Section 1 An Atmosphere of Faith 

#### Devotion, faith and blessings 
True Mother spent most of her childhood at the house of her maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo,
because her mother, Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim), was leading a life of faith devoted to receiving
the Lord at the Second Advent. Both her mother and her grandmother raised her to inherit the
core of this life of faith. Daemonim strove to raise Mother well. While they were living in the
North, Daemonim often had dreams in which she saw Satan trying to harm her daughter. These
dreams continued until Mother was six years old. In another dream, Rev. Kim Seong-do appeared
to her and told her to raise True Mother well because she was not her own child but God's.
Hence, Daemonim devoted herself to raising her as well as she could in the position of her
daughter's nanny. Since Daemonim walked such a path of trials, True Mother also had to walk
that path alongside her until she could stand as Heaven's Bride.
1. About one month after my birth, my mother had a dream. Rev. Kim Seong-do of the New Jesus Church
appeared to her in white clothes on a white cloud, and said, "Soon-ae, you must have worried a lot about
your baby. But don't you worry. She is the daughter of the Lord, and you are like her nursemaid. Make
sure to nurse her and raise her well." My mother engraved those words deep in her heart. When I was
growing up, I was very different from other children. I could speak and walk before I was a year old.
When I spoke, my pronunciation was very clear. This is why my grandmother said, "This child is
different." I had a good mind, and I was never the slightest bit untidy. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
2. Throughout their lives my grandmother and my mother lived their lives of faith preparing to receive the
Returning Lord. They did not compromise with the world. They were totally dedicated to heaven 24 hours
a day. They offered their utmost devotion to make preparations to receive the Lord. Their life of faith was
not like the ordinary faith of those who stay comfortably in their homes. Since my mother's investment in
her life of faith caused her to be rarely at home, I lived mostly with my grandmother. So I naturally
inherited my faith from my grandmother. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
3. My grandmother knew God's Will for me, so she cared for me with sincerity. She raised me in purity,
untainted by the world, so that I might become the precious daughter whom heaven could use. My
grandmother repeatedly told me, "Your father is Heavenly Father." Thus, when we talked about my father
I always thought about Heavenly Father rather than my physical father. Whenever I thought of God I
always had a warm feeling. Anyone who looked at my family from an external perspective would have
found it incomprehensible. Yet, growing up in it, I never felt anything lacking; nor did I have anything to
complain about. I lived with a feeling that something or someone was embracing me, and I felt free in my
heart. I never asked my mother or my grandmother anything about my physical father, such as why my
mother and father lived the way they did. Throughout my life I never had any hard feelings or complaints
whatsoever about my physical parents. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
4. Until I was six, I lived at Anju, South Pyeongan Province. During those years Satan would appear in
my mother's dreams trying to kill me. For six long years, she had to fight Satan. However, my mother did
not yet understand the deep meaning of this. She only wondered, "Why is Satan continually trying to kill
my baby?" (True Mother, 1977/05/03)
5. My mother first followed the New Jesus Church, then the Holy Lord Church and finally the Inside the
Womb Church. In that church she fervently prayed with longing for the Lord to return. When I was about
four years old, I began to make conditions of devotion with her, by offering bows at her side. At the
church everyone observed the official times for offering bows, which were twice a day, in the morning
and the evening. Some people also offered bowing conditions at other times, such as in the middle of
meditation. This lifestyle did not change until I was six years old, when we moved down to the South.
(True Mother, 2013/12/06)
6. I believe that my childhood was a period for me to keep separate from the evils of the world, so I could
become the Bride of the Lord. My original personality was not extroverted; I was inclined to enjoy my
inner world, away from the secular world.
True Father once said that my grandmother and my mother dedicated everything to bequeath the way of
heaven's heart to me. They did not mind even if their flesh was torn or their bones were broken; they kept
on walking the path of absolute obedience with unchanging, loyal hearts. Father also said that in order
that I would not be in contact with circumstances full of worldly temptations, God led me to a life that
was separated from the world. (True Mother, 2014/10/11) 

#### The Korean War
In 1948, when True Mothers maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo, her mother, Hong Soon-ae
(Daemonim), and True Mother herself were attending the Inside the Womb Church in the North,
that church came under religious persecution by the communist authorities. There was an
incident in which Jo Won-mo and Daemonim were detained for 11 days. As the persecution
became more severe, Grandmother Jo suggested that they go to the South.
Around that time, heaven gave Daemonim a revelation that they should move to the South. The
South was foreign to the three of them, but since they heard that the first son of Rev. Kim Seongdo of the Holy Lord Church in Cheolsan had already gone to the South, they decided to join him
there. Also, Daemonim wanted to see her younger brother, Hong Soon-jeong. He had returned to
Korea in the middle of his studies in Japan due to the war situation, joined the South Korean
army, studied pharmacy at the Korean Military Academy and, at that time, held the rank of first
lieutenant. So they departed in the middle of the night and traveled to South Korea at the risk of
their lives. After surmounting many difficulties, they safely arrived in the South.
7. When I lived at Anju, my mother was rarely home, because she was investing herself in an ardent life
of faith. Given that situation, I grew up under the care of my mother's family. My father was also a devout
Christian. In 1946, he was the first of my family to move down to South Korea to evade threats from the
communist authorities. I vaguely remember that my father visited my mother and me at our home and
asked us to leave with him. (True Mother, 2004/11/23)
8. It was very hard to live a life of faith under the communist government. So my grandmother, my
mother and I journeyed to the South. We were to join Hong Soon-jeong, my maternal uncle who was
living there. As we journeyed south, we three women of three generations continued our bowing
condition for the Returning Lord. My maternal grandfather, Hong Yu-il, wanted to stay in Pyongyang to
protect that city, because he had received a revelation that Pyongyang was the Palace of Eden. We never
saw him again. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
9. The journey to South Korea was not easy. We had to walk on the uneven ground of the plowed and
furrowed rice paddies, and the mud stuck to our feet. We shivered in the cold weather as we continued
walking toward the South. When at last we arrived at the 38th parallel, we were captured by soldiers of
the North Korean People's Army, which was tightly guarding the area. They locked us up in an empty
barn along with others whom they had arrested. The soldiers were rough with the men but treated the
women and children better. The grown-ups told me to give food to the soldiers who had to guard us
despite the cold weather. I was nervous with fear, but keeping myself poised I brought food to the soldiers
with a smile. After I did that a few times, the soldiers' hearts softened. One night they released us and told
us to return home. The power of love brought us from the brink of death to life. (True Mother,
2013/12/06)
10. My grandmother was with me all the time. Whenever we walked on the street, people treated me
affectionately, saying I was very cute. So at a time when people were not free to travel as they desired, I
could freely go about and do errands for others. For this I was greatly appreciated and loved. It was the
same when we were journeying to the South. Because I, a little girl, was accompanying the women, the
North Korean soldiers who captured us were more lenient with us. They even released us on the way, and
hence we could safely continue our journey and cross the 38th parallel.
It was when we had just crossed the 38th parallel that we ran into difficulties. The noise we made as we
walked attracted the attention of South Korean soldiers. They were pointing their guns toward us, but at
that moment I started singing a song. At the sound of my singing they put down their guns. Then they
greeted us warmly, saying, "You must have had a hard time traveling with such a beautiful daughter," and
let us go southward. (True Mother, 2004/11/23)
11. While my mother was attending the Inside the Womb Church, her brother, my uncle Hong Soonjeong, returned home from studying abroad in Japan. He then went to South Korea and joined the army
there. My uncle was a dignified and charming person. In those days many intelligent people agreed with
the ideology of communism, and he too thought that communism was good. But he was disappointed
with the communist system, as its reality was so different from its teaching. This is why he went to South
Korea and joined the military instead of returning to North Korea where his parents were. He realized that
the reality of communism contradicted its theory.
My grandmother very much missed her son while he was serving in the military. One of the reasons my
grandmother, my mother and I came to the South was to see him. We went to Seoul and settled there.
When we first arrived in Seoul we lived at Hyochang-dong, and that is where I entered elementary school.
I was popular wherever I went and grew up receiving much love from the many people around me. This is
why I later thought, "If I had not married young, I could have been lost to the secular world. Maybe this is
the reason God brought me to the Holy Wedding early in life and embraced me in His arms." (True
Mother, 1999/10/21)
12. Heaven led and protected us even in Seoul when we were searching for my uncle. We suffered
tremendously to cross the 38th parallel and come to the South, but we had no idea how to find my uncle
once we arrived in Seoul. My grandmother and mother asked around for him without really knowing how
to locate him. It was not an easy task. But miraculously, we met a friend of his. It was indeed due to
heaven's help and guidance. At that time my uncle was living in an army tent near Seoul, and he was very
happy to see us when we visited him. He said he was glad we came, because he had been worrying about
his family back home. My uncle quickly found a house where the three of us could live. Later I
discovered that our house was very close to our church headquarters in Cheongpa-dong. (True Mother,
2013/12/06)
13. I was eight years old (by Korean reckoning) when the Korean War broke out. We were living in Seoul
so we had to flee from there, and my uncle helped us tremendously. As a medical officer in the army, he
knew in advance that the Han River Bridge was going to be blown up. He had a pass to cross the bridge,
and he drove my grandmother and me across it in a military vehicle so we could flee further south.
Daemonim did not come with us; she thought only about meeting the Lord, for whom she continued
offering her sincere devotion. As soon as we crossed the bridge, my uncle told us to get out of the vehicle
and take cover. We did as he said. At that moment the bridge was blown up, and many soldiers who were
also crossing the bridge fell into the river and lost their lives.
Although we were safe because of my uncle's help, even now whenever I cross the Han River Bridge I
feel great pain from the memory of that incident. Indeed, most Koreans in my age group suffered
hardships from the war; however, I was always protected by God's grace. I remember the time once when
I caught a cold while we were fleeing south and my mother put a piece of taffy in my mouth to keep me
from coughing. I also remember when she placed a mixture of rice and cactus on my wounds to heal
them. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
14. After the Han River Bridge blew up at 3:00 in the morning on June 28, 1950, my family continued
fleeing south to escape the advancing North Korean troops. We stayed in a refugee camp for military
families in Jeolla Province. We returned to Seoul after it was retaken on September 28 and lodged in a
vacant house where a Japanese family had lived. Then China entered the war and Seoul fell again, this
time into the hands of the Chinese army. Hence, on January 4, 1951, as the South Korean army retreated
from Seoul, we again had to leave our home and flee. We were able to board a special train for military
families that left Seoul ahead of the civilian populace; we went down to Daegu.
The Korean army moved its headquarters to Daegu as well, and we lived near my maternal uncle's home.
I always realized how God was with us, even in the midst of our chaotic journey as refugees. As God had
protected us when we left the North to journey to the South, He was also with us when we fled from the
battles of the Korean War. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
