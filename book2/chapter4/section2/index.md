## Chapter 4 True Mother's Childhood and Youth

### Section 2 Education and Encounter with Father

#### Heaven's guidance 
After coming to the South, True Mother attended Hyochang Elementary School in Seoul. After she
left Seoul she continued her schooling, even though she moved several times -- to Daegu, to
Seoguipo on Jeju Island, and to Chun-cheon in Gangwon Province. Her report card from
Bongeui Elementary School in Chuncheon records that she was "very pure, kind and polite,
shows a noble attitude, the most feminine among the students in the class." When she graduated
from that school, she was given an award as an honor student.
True Mother then attended Seong-jeong Girls Middle School from April 1956 to March 1959.
This school was purchased by True Parents in April 1987, at which time it changed its name to
Seonjeong Middle School. In March 1959, True Mother entered Saint Joseph's Nursing School in
Seoul, which today is the Catholic University Nursing School.
1. After coming to the South, we rented a room in Hyochang-dong in Seoul, and I entered Hyochang
Elementary School. I continued in school when we moved to Daegu and then to Jeju Island. My mother
moved us to Jeju Island in 1954 with the intention of raising me in a pure environment. There I attended
Shinhyo Elementary School in Seoguipo, which is Hyodon Elementary School today. I transferred into
the 5th grade. Then we received a letter from my maternal uncle. He had been transferred to Chuncheon
and was posted as chief of the supply depot there. He asked us to move to Chuncheon, and we did.
We rented a room in Yaksa-dong near my uncle's house in Hyoja-dong, and I transferred to Bongeui
Elementary School in Chuncheon. I soon became a 6th grader, and I graduated the following year, on
March 2, 1956, in the schools 11th class.
Afterward, with the help of my uncle, on April 10, 1956 I entered Seongjeong Girls Middle School,
located in Sajik-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul. I graduated as a member of the school's third class, on March
25, 1959. During that time I lived with my uncle's family at Donam-dong and Shindang-dong and
commuted to school in Sajik-dong. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
2. In middle school, I was the head of the Student Activities Council. I remember the time when I had to
stand on stage and explain the council's decisions to all the students of the school. I later heard that after
my speech, my Korean teacher and other teachers remarked, "Wow! Hak Ja, you were great!" People
around me always had the impression that I was a quiet and well-mannered student, someone whom it
was difficult to be close to. I guess they were surprised that a person such as me could give a public
speech, although it was only a simple presentation. This was my first experience speaking in front of
many people. (True Mother, 1991/11/10)
3. Recently, one of my old friends visited me. She and I once lived in the same town and attended the
same middle school. Her father loved me very much. Another of my friends was my senior by one year.
She cared deeply for me and used to say, "You are dignified and pretty." She later moved to Canada and
often sent me letters. When she had opportunities to visit Korea, we would meet each other. One day I
visited my old school and found that the teacher of my Korean class was still there. I can still recall his
face. Also, I remember that my mathematics teacher cared for me very much. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
4. When I started high school, it was not very long after the Korean War had ended. I remembered how
all the streets had been filled with people injured because of the war. Children orphaned by the war, and
even children with parents, suffered greatly from hunger and disease. People were unable to get any
treatment when they fell sick. I felt so sorry for them. I wanted to heal their pain; that is why I decided to
attend nursing school. I wanted to find a way to help them. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
5. My teachers loved and protected me at every school I attended. I am not sure whether it was because I
gave them the impression I was reliable and modest, but for some reason my teachers cared for me. Some
teachers said, "You are not like most children these days. Go out and get involved." It was not that I had a
lot of worries on my mind. I just liked to sit and stay quiet. Even during adolescence, when I was growing
into womanhood, I never worried about my life because my grandmother and mother, who were always
attending heaven, taught me to live in faith.
Under my mother's strict education, I spent my time immersed in reading books of various kinds. For a
time I thought that I wanted to lead a country life with a couple of my close friends and plant fruit trees.
My friends said, "Although you are very prim and proper, you will actually be the first of us to marry." I
have not thought much about my student days since the Holy Wedding, so I cannot remember much about
that time. Besides, I really have not had time to think back. Recently some old friends visited me, and that
brought back some of these old memories. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
6. I was known as a student who liked reading and music in a comfortable and quiet atmosphere. Also,
people had the impression that I was quite intellectual. I was not extremely emotional or excitable. Come
to think of it, I might have given a first impression of being a little cold. In the dormitory I lived like a
nun. My life was sheltered from the secular environment, like a flower blooming in a greenhouse. Only
later did I realize that my life was that way to separate me from the fallen world. It was heaven's
preparation, so that one day I could meet the Lord at the Second Advent and become his Bride. (True
Mother, 1977/05/03)
7. Until 1960, I lived mostly in seclusion, as if I were buried inside my clothes. God led me to lead a
simple life that did not require me to compromise with the secular world. God set up circumstances that
thoroughly protected me, as if He did not want me even to breathe the air of Satan's world. In such
surroundings, I eliminated my own thoughts and just led my life by letting God alone guide me. I used to
write a diary. Amazingly enough, although I did not write with much thought, it was something like "Urie
sowon-eun tongil,‚Äù meaning, "Our cherished hope is for North and South Korea to be reunited." Later,
when I heard Fathers words on the subject, I recalled what I had written in my diary and found it very
meaningful. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
8. Mother is so natural on stage. The first time she sang a song in front of an audience was in her second
year of high school. She was famous for her singing. Regardless of the audience, she stood tall onstage
like a champion. (227-022, 1992/02/10)
9. To me, Mother is flawless. I see nothing but goodness in her. This did not happen just overnight.
Whenever she meets people, if they are men, she compares each one with me and thinks, "This man has a
quality just like True Father." By thinking that way, she can be openhearted toward them. It is so
beautiful. Look at her eyes and hands. They show how observant and sensitive she is. When she hears me
speak a sentence, she analyzes its structure -- what the subject is, what the object is, what the clauses are,
and so forth. What I am saying is that she is smart and analyzes things well. In her teens, her friends said
she was an impressive and unforgettable girl, and I think it is because of her powers of observation. When
she went places, she was prudent about the route she chose. She would travel only on the route that she
felt comfortable with. (435-020, 2004/01/31) 

#### Encounter with Father 
Rev. Kim Seong-do, the founder of the Holy Lord Church, gave these last words to her first son,
Jeong Seok-cheon, "If I cannot fulfill the mission that God gave me, it will be fulfilled through
someone else. That representative of God will also be misunderstood, like me. The church he
leads will be misunderstood and persecuted as a church of fornication, and he will suffer
imprisonment. If you find such a church, know that it is a true church, and go to that church."
Mr. Jeong went down to the South with his older sister Jeong Seok-on. They carried with them the
belief that the Will of God that was not fulfilled in their mothers' generation would definitely be
accomplished in the next generation or a future generation. They continued worship services in
their own home and looked around for where that was being realized.
One day, they read a newspaper article about an incident at Ehwa University in which many
students were expelled from the school. That is how Jeong Seok-on and her daughter came to
visit the Unification Church, thinking it might be the church their mother, Rev. Kim Seong-do,
had spoken of. At that time it was located in Jangchung-dong in Seoul. On October 4, 1955, True
Father was released from Seodaemun Prison with the verdict that he was innocent of all charges.
After True Father heard what Rev. Kim had told Jeong Seok-cheon, Father visited Mr. Jeong's
home on Dongseong Street in Daegu. Jeong Seok-cheon then wrote a letter to Hong Soon-ae
about his encounter with True Father and encouraged her to meet him. That is how True Mother
and her mother Hong Soon-ae came to meet True Father.
10. After True Father was released from Seodaemun Prison he traveled to Daegu, where he held revival
meetings to inspire the members. Around that time my mother, who was then living in Chuncheon,
received a letter from Jeong Seok-cheon. His letter said, "I found a church that is just like the Holy Lord
Church. The founder of that church is speaking here in Daegu. Come as soon as you can and listen to
him." However, my mother's circumstances were such that we could not immediately go to Daegu. A
month later, in December, she went there and visited Jeong Seok-cheon. He told her, "I finally found the
one we have been looking for, the Lord at the Second Advent. He came to Daegu, and I heard him speak."
He told her that Father had returned to Seoul. He also said that Fathers teaching was the same as the
teaching of the Inside the Womb Church. My mother was happy with the thought that when she went to
Seoul she would finally meet the person whom she had yearned to see for so long. Yet for some reason
she also felt unworthy to see him. That is why she invested her efforts to prepare her heart. Then that
night she had a dream. In the dream she saw a pair of golden dragons; they were hunched over and
looking in the direction of Seoul. My mother thought to herself, "When I was preparing to come here to
Daegu, I had a dream in which I saw one white dragon. Now, as I am about to leave Daegu, in my dream
I see a pair of golden dragons. How strange!"
Immediately she set out for Seoul. There she visited the former headquarters church, which was located in
Cheongpa-dong, where she met Father for the first time and paid her respects. She was surprised, for he
was the very man whom she had seen in the two dreams she had while attending the Inside the Womb
Church. There he was, the Lord whom she had yearned to see and whom she had dreamed about. My
mother told me she was so overwhelmed that she did not know how to behave in his presence. (True
Mother, 2014/10/11)
11. I did not meet True Father in North Korea. The first time I met him was in Seoul, after I came down to
South Korea. At that time I was 13 years old and had recently graduated from elementary school. The
meeting happened shortly after my mother and I joined the church. I was then living in Chuncheon, far
from where True Father lived in Seoul. My mother held me by the hand and brought me to the Cheongpadong church in March, 1956. That was when I met True Father for the first time. After that first encounter
at the church, my mother and I continued attending that church on Sundays. During that time I graduated
from middle school and went on to high school. (True Mother, 1977/05/03)
12. I can still vividly recall the moment True Father saw me in my student uniform and closed his eyes in
gratitude to God for guiding me to him. I always had the feeling that God prepares everything that He
deems necessary, especially when I think of how He shaped my character and guided the way I had been
living my life. When Isaac went up the mountain with Abraham to make an offering to God, he asked his
father where the offering was. Abraham simply replied that God would provide. Yet, although Isaac was
just a young boy, he had already figured out his situation.
Likewise, from my childhood I intuitively sensed that I must fulfill something important in the future. I
would say that subconsciously I understood that I was being prepared to become the Bride of the
Returning Lord. My path was already decided, and I was born with the destiny to go that way. Other
women could not have borne the weight of my position, but I could because of all that I had faced
previously and overcome. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
13. I guess you are curious about the conversation that True Father and I had at our first meeting after he
decided to accept me as his Bride. In those days our church members loved Father, but they were scared
of him as well. Yet I had no fear of him. I felt that True Father was exactly like my maternal grandfather
and would not get upset with anything I said. I suppose some people around me might have thought, "For
such a young lady, she is incredibly bold." Yet at that moment I felt as if True Father were my
grandfather, father, groom, brother, and even my son. (True Mother, 2004/09/16)
14. Adam and Eve fell when they went against God's Word. Yet I thought of it this way: Even if God had
not warned them, they should have had the thought, based on the working of their original minds, to
observe God's Word, since they were living at a time when they could directly converse with God. I grew
up already thinking about God's providential history. So when I met with True Father at the age of 17, I
had already made this resolution, "I will end, within my lifetime, the history of restoration through
indemnity that God has walked in suffering; I will do this myself" I did not think this way because
someone taught me to; I made this resolution on my own. The reason I could do so was because I knew
God. (True Mother, 2012/01/07)
15. When I met True Father, I already knew providential history. I had not studied the Principle, but I
knew about the history of the providence of restoration through indemnity. That is why I thought to
myself, "In order for True Father to be able to proclaim that he has completed and concluded his mission
as the Messiah, I must offer him my effort in support. I will not shift that responsibility to any other
person. As for myself, I will accomplish that responsibility. I will advance the Will for as long as I live
and bring it to pass. Without a doubt I will defeat Satan." It is for this purpose that I have dedicated my
mind and body and sacrificed my entire life. (True Mother, 2013/08/24) 

#### Life of faith 
True Mother came down to the South with her maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo, and her
mother, Hong Soon-ae, in 1948. They moved several times -- from Seoul to Daegu, then to Jeju
Island and then to Chuncheon, where they continued their life of faith. When they were staying
temporarily at the home of her mother's friend in Daegu, right after arriving in the South, a
stranger who saw True Mother described her, "She is the most divine young lady in heaven and
on earth." It was this way wherever True Mother went: She caught people's eye, and people
received spiritual messages testifying to her.
16. Rev. Kim Seong-do, founder of the Holy Lord Church, passed away after she was released from
prison. Although the remaining members of her family continued in that church, the providential mission
to prepare for the Returning Lord passed to the Inside the Womb Church led by Rev. Heo Ho-bin. The
Holy Lord Church could not take root under the communist regime in North Korea. Rev. Kim's first son,
Jeong Seokcheon, went to the South and became involved in a mining business. Later he purchased a
house on Dongseong Street in Daegu and started a business that sold rice and fuel.
During the Korean War, when we moved to Daegu, we had a reunion with Jeong Seok-cheon. We were
gathered with his family at his house and talking about this and that, when they said, "When we were in
the North attending the Holy Lord Church, we received much grace from the New Lord (Kim Seong-do).
We also experienced great works of the Spirit when we attended the Inside the Womb Church of Rev.
Heo. They were preparing for the Lord at the Second Advent to come to Korea. Let us pray continually
and earnestly to find him." Mr. Jeong called his older sister Jeong Seok-on to come up from Busan. She
also joined their family gatherings, which were filled with intense prayer. In this way we continued our
life of faith. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
17. When I was very young and my mother was running a small store in Daegu, one day an enlightened
Buddhist wearing a bamboo hat passed by and saw me. He gave the remarkable testimony, "This daughter
is so precious that not even ten sons can match her. So please raise her well. When she reaches 17, she
will marry a man who is much older than she is. She will live in great wealth, with fortune from the land,
sea and sky." My mother was amazed at his testimony and asked him what it meant. He answered that I
was born with that destiny. Hearing this, my mother resolved even more strongly to live a diligent life of
faith as she searched for the truth. In addition, she resolved to raise me in purity until we could meet the
Returning Lord.
That is why she took me to Jeju Island. There she cultivated her spiritual life and subjected herself to
harsh rigors, including eating nothing but uncooked food. Later, when she met True Father, she thought
about how she could raise me to be an important worker in the Unification Church. Such are the extreme
and tearful stories hidden within the providence before I was brought to God as a pure offering for God's
Will. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
18. My grandmother Jo Won-mo led us in daily family worship. She made a point of staying away from
evil influences in her daily life. She told me many Bible stories. She read the Bible seriously, and led a
sincere life of faith with her utmost devotion, always keeping the Bible within her reach. Naturally, I read
the Bible with her and lived a life of faith guided by our Heavenly Parent. We continued this life while we
lived as refugees in Daegu, when I transferred to the school on Jeju Island, and later in Chuncheon, after
the Korean War. When I was attending Sunday school at a church in Daegu, I often sang for the
congregation as a representative of the students at the Sunday school. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
19. While living in Daegu as a refugee during the Korean War, my mother met Jeong Seok-cheon, the
first son of the founder of the Holy Lord Church, Rev. Kim Seong-do. After speaking with him, she came
to believe that the New Lord would come to South Korea. She prayed hard to meet the Returning Lord,
while keeping to an ascetic diet of raw pine needles. I was an elementary school student at that time. I was
a good student and was very popular with the other students.
However, my mother did not feel comfortable that I had become a focal point, because there were
revelations about me saying I would become the Lord's Bride, the Lord's daughter, and other similar
testimonies. As a result, in 1954 my mother and I moved to Jeju Island. She wanted to protect me for the
day when she hoped we would meet the Lord at the Second Advent. I remember suffering from
seasickness during the trip to Jeju Island. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
20. Because I had been given the blessing to be Heaven's Bride, Daemonim's main concern was to raise
me pure and untainted by the world. So the year after the Korean War ended, when Korea was in chaos,
my mother and I departed from the Korean mainland and went to live on Jeju Island. We lived there for
about nine months. Jeong Pyeong-hwa, the second son of Rev. Kim Seong-do, the founder of the Holy
Lord Church, was a man of such fervent faith that he wanted to experience the pain of Jesus. He even reenacted the crucifixion and wore a crown of thorns. Daemonim joined him and led a more arduous life of
faith than ever before. Every day she worked in the fields, eating nothing but raw food, and every night
she exerted herself to the utmost in prayer. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
