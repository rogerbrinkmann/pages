<h1 id="chapter-2-true-mothers-birth">Chapter 2. True Mother's Birth</h1>
<h2 id="section-1-background">Section 1. Background</h2>
<h3 id="spiritual-preparations">Spiritual preparations</h3>
<p>For God to send the Returning Lord, His begotten Son, to earth, He conducted a special
providence. He did likewise to send Heavens Bride to be His begotten Daughter and the
embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Heaven prepared many Spirit-led churches in order to send True
Mother as the new Eve. Around the time of True Mothers birth, many spiritual churches emerged
on the Korean Peninsula. With her family centrally involved in them, their purpose was to
prepare for True Mother.</p>
<p>True Mother was born on the 6th day of the 1st lunar month (February 10) in 1943, at her
maternal grandparents' home at number 26, Shineui village in the township of Anju, South
Pyeongan Province. She was the only daughter of her father, Han Seung-oon, and her mother,
Hong Soon-ae, who later received the title Daemonim.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When we look at the central figures of providential history, we can well understand how important the
mother's role is. Abraham, Moses, Jesus and others blossomed and made a new history based on the role
of their wife or mother. However, internally their personal histories were filled with bitter sorrow, misery
and suffering. Where I stand today, I can see that nothing that happened leading up to my birth was a
coincidence. Rev. Lee Ho-bin, who was well known before the liberation of Korea, received a revelation
that led him to arrange my parents' marriage. (True Mother, 1988/02/24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infants typically cry, "Wahhh!" as soon as they are born, but I was told that I sang "La la la!" instead.
So, Jo Won-mo, my maternal grandmother, said, "It seems she will be a singer when she grows up." After
eating the first seaweed soup after my delivery, my mother (Daemonim) fell asleep holding me in her
arms; then she had a dream. In that dream, a darkish Satan with horns on his head appeared to her. He
said, "Because of the birth of this child, I will have to die," and then he tried to kill me. My mother yelled
out, "Get away, Satan! She is such a precious daughter to me; how dare you try to kill her!" My mother
screamed so loud that my grandmother said, "You must be exhausted after giving birth." My mother
replied, "No, it's not that. I screamed because Satan was trying to kill the baby." My grandmother said,
"That is so strange." But my mother thought to herself, "Since Satan tried to kill her as soon as she was
born, I have to raise this child with my utmost sincere devotion. I am going to raise her pure, beautiful
and untouched by sin, and then offer her to the Lord." (True Mother, 1977/05/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mother, Daemonim, told me that she had a mysterious dream right after she gave birth to me. At
the time Korea was under the rule of Japan, and the war in the Pacific was at its peak. People dispatched
by the Japanese governor-general's office in Korea raided every house and took all the grain and metal
objects they could find, to supply food for the soldiers and make arms for the war. In her dream, all those
things they had seized from Korea were piled up high in the land of Japan. Then all of a sudden
everything that had been confiscated returned to Korea in a ship crossing the Korea Strait, and it was all
piled up high, sack upon sack, in the front yard of our house. At this point, Daemonim woke up. As I
think of it now, that dream symbolically showed the path that the mother must follow, reconciling and
uniting Cain and Abel to move toward our Heavenly Parent. (True Mother, 2012/12/25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Korea there were many special Spirit-led churches. These were different from conventional
Christian churches whose members were comfortable with formal worship and with the blind and simple
faith that, just by believing in Jesus and the Bible, they would be able to go to the kingdom of heaven.
These churches received numerous revelations from God that they should make preparations to welcome
the Lord at his Second Advent and find the Lord's Bride. Such was the landscape of faith in Korea
following the Second World War. I was born into a family that was spiritually prepared, whose
preparation included participation in those Spirit-led churches.<br />
Today as I reflect upon the circumstances of that time, I am drenched in sorrow. It is because I recall
memories of the indescribable suffering endured by the churches to which my mother (Daemonim)
belonged. The members of those churches lived entirely according to the divine revelations they received.
These revelations directed them to walk an indemnity course in order to prepare an easier path for the
Lord. It was an unbelievable course filled with difficulties and hardships. Some of those members died in
prison.<br />
Having been called by God to prepare for the Messiah, they overcame their difficulties by carrying with
them only the hope that someday they would be able to meet him. So, with devotion and attendance, they
made extensive preparations to welcome the Returning Lord. Among the things they did was to prepare
everything for him, from spoons for him to eat with to clothes for him to wear. The revelations they
received were so detailed that they knew even the size of his clothes.<br />
Yet while they endured indescribable suffering to carry out these directions, unfortunately they died, one
by one, unable to meet the Lord. However, their mission was passed down through three generations, and
I was born at the culmination of their revelations. (True Mother, 1977/05/03)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="heavens-bride-prophecy">Heaven's Bride prophecy</h3>
<p>True Mother's birth was significant because it was the fruit of God's providential history. Her
birth transcended the birth of an individual; it was the fruit of 2,000 years of Christian history,
and it was linked to the Spirit-led churches that arose in Korea to welcome the Lord at his
Second Advent. These churches produced this fruit through three generations: her maternal
grandmother, Jo Won-mo; her mother, Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim); and finally True Mother
herself.</p>
<p>Specifically, shortly after the birth of True Mother, Rev. Kim Seong-do of the Holy Lord Church
died in prison from the torture she received there. Thereupon the mission was passed down to the
Inside the Womb Church led by Rev. Heo Ho-bin. As Rev. Heo was also imprisoned, her mother,
taking her place, testified to True Mother, who was six years old at the time. She blessed her,
saying, "You will be Heaven's Bride." Even before the birth of True Mother there were
prophecies about her, such as, "She will become the queen of the universe." Through this process,
the foundation of these churches' conditions of devotion to receive the Lord at his Second Advent
was passed down to True Mother.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My father, Han Seung-oon, was born in Anju; he worked as a teacher all his life. Although he was a
strong and robust man with a large frame, he had an eye for detail and he was always serving others. Most
notably, he was a devout Christian; he also worked as a leader at the New Jesus Church led by Rev. Yi
Yong-do. As a believer and educator, his life was always busy. When my mother (Daemonim) moved to
Anju with my grandmother, they attended the New Jesus Church in Anju to continue their life of faith.
That is where my mother and father met and came to know each other, and eventually ended up marrying.<br />
One day during the time they were living a devout Christian life, my mother received a revelation,
"Daughter of Hong Yu-il, rejoice! If you give birth to a son, he will be the king of the universe, and if a
daughter, she will be the queen of the universe." After she received this message, my parents married. My
father was 26 years old, and my mother was 21 years old. After that, my mother made continuous and
strenuous efforts to find the Returning Lord. Later, she joined the Holy Lord Church in Cheolsan, which
required her to travel back and forth between Anju and Cheolsan. I was conceived nine years after my
parents' marriage, as the fruit of their sincere devotion and devout life of faith. (True Mother, 1977/05/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was born, God gave revelations about his plan that the Lord at his Second Advent would be
born on earth. These revelations were given to a woman named Rev. Heo Ho-bin. When I was six, Rev.
Heo's mother met me and prophesied, "You will surely be Heaven's Bride." She had received that
revelation about me though I was still just a young girl. In those days in North Korea there were quite a
few Spirit-led churches that had been prepared and called by God. In fact, the Christian faith was so
strong in Pyongyang that the city was called "the Jerusalem of the East." (True Mother, 1977/05/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In North Korea, as the power of the communist authorities grew stronger, the persecution of religion
became severe. In August 1946, Rev. Heo Ho-bin was taken to the Daedong Detention Center in
Pyongyang. While in jail she received a revelation that she would meet the Returning Lord. Around the
same time True Father was arrested while evangelizing in Pyongyang and was taken to the same jail.
While in the jail, True Father managed to send a note to Rev. Heo through her chief disciple. However,
the note was discovered by a prison guard and True Father was tortured so severely that his teeth were
broken.<br />
It was during that time, before I came down to South Korea, that Rev. Heo's mother called me to go see
her after receiving a revelation about me. I was then six years old. Rev. Heo's church was fulfilling the
mission of the Bride of the Lord at the Second Advent, and Rev. Heo's mother gave me a benediction that
I would take the position of that Bride. She said in her prayer that I was supposed to fulfill a great
mission. I still vividly recall it: an elderly lady in a white Korean dress said that she had received a
revelation about me from heaven and she called me to come into her room alone in order to give me that
blessing. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rev. Kim Seong-do's church was on the west coast of North Korea. After she died, Rev. Heo Ho-bin
became its leader. True Mother's mother (Daemonim) was a devout member of that church. She first
brought Mother to that church when she was four years old, and Rev. Heo's mother gave her blessing to
Mother when she was six. That blessing symbolized the bequeathal to Mother, the succession of the
mission to attend the Returning Lord.
When I first met Mother, I already knew about this succession. Everything that God had prepared was
realized in 1960; that is how True Parents were able to emerge today. Based on this, it became possible to
bestow the marriage Blessing on the church members so as to make them God's children. (052-186,
1971/12/29)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="true-mothers-name">True Mother's name</h3>
<p>Shortly after True Mother was born, her father, Han Seung-oon, named her Hak Ja, choosing hak
according to a dream in which he saw two cranes. Hak means "crane" and ja means "son," and is
often used to mean "child" in women's names. True Father gave a different interpretation, "She
will come forth as the partner of God, by becoming the greatest scholar (another meaning for
"hakja") of God's bitter sorrow." He said, further, "The last character of her name, ja symbolizes
that she is destined to be bonded with God's prince."</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was told that at the time when I was born, my father had a dream-like vision in which he saw
beautiful, bright sunshine beaming down on a thick forest of pine trees. In that forest, two cranes were
dancing in harmony. So he named me Hak Ja. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Mother's name is Hak Ja. These characters mean "crane" and "son." Cranes fly over the
Himalayas and then land on the plains where they hatch their eggs. This symbolizes the mission that Eve
is to fulfill. The character ja, meaning "son," symbolizes that she is the woman who yearns for the Son of
God. True Mother's mission is to climb over the Himalayas and give birth to sons and daughters in the
world of peace. Cranes do not eat just anything; they eat only clean things. They eat things that are
nutritious but light. Once a crane starts to fly, it hardly changes direction as it flies high in the sky. For
this reason, people in the East love cranes. (246-285, 1993/04/20)</p>

<h2 id="section-2-true-mothers-family">Section 2. True Mother's Family</h2>
<h3 id="gods-preparation">God's preparation</h3>
<p>True Mother's father, Han Seung-oon, was born January 20, 1909, and died on March 18, 1978.
His father was Han Byeong-geon, his mother was Choi Gi-byeong, and he was the first son
among five siblings. In May 1946, while working as a schoolteacher, he fled to the South. After
that he worked as a teacher in elementary schools in Seoul and in Gyeonggi Province until
February 1974. He dedicated 41 years of his life to being a teacher, in both North and South
Korea.<br />
Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim) was born on the 22nd day of the 2nd lunar month in 1914, into a
devout Christian family. Her father was Hong Yu-il. Her mother, Jo Won-mo (who lived from the
7th day of the 11th lunar month of 1889 to the 3rd day of the 9th lunar month of 1962), bore him
one son and one daughter. Daemonim was their first child. Jo Won-mo, True Mother's maternal
grandmother, was a diligent and active woman like contemporary women. It is known that one of
her ancestors, Jo Han-jun, built a significant stone bridge across the Dallae River at Jeongju in
North Pyeongan Province, investing his entire fortune to build it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was born at dawn on the 6th day of the 1 st lunar month in 1943, at Anju, South Pyeongan Province. It
was not a remote village, yet there was a hill, and also a stream, right behind my house. The surrounding
village had a very warm and cozy feeling, like a hen embracing her chicks. In the backyard was a
cornfield that my family harvested for food. I remember how big those corncobs were. In the area
between True Father's hometown of Jeongju and my hometown of Anju there is a river. (True Mother,
1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My hometown, Anju, is in a strategic military and political location. It is one of the two important cities
that Pyeong-an Province was named for. The character pyeong is the first character of the city of
Pyongyang, and the character an is the first character of Anju. Anju is located in a natural environment of
expansive plains that are good for agriculture. Historians say that the town existed in the time before the
era called Gojoseon ("Ancient Joseon," 7th - 1st centuries BCE). The Cheongcheon River that flows
through this area separates North Pyeongan Province from South Pyeongan Province. Anju is about 60
kilometers from True Father's hometown of Jeongju and 75 kilometers from the city of Pyongyang.
During the time Daemonim was offering conditions of devotion every day and searching for new words
of truth, she would travel to the Holy Lord Church in Cheolsan, which was about 120 kilometers away.
(True Mother, 2013/12/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Mother's maternal grandmother Jo Won-mo was a direct descendant of Jo Han-jun. The character
jo of her family name means nation. It signifies that Daemonim's mother was in the position of a mother
of the nation. That is the way the generations of her family tradition connected through history. Here is a
true story: After no one had repaired or maintained the Dallae Bridge in Jeongju for many decades, it
started to deteriorate. Eventually it reached the point that people could not cross the bridge, and the road
was blocked. Remnants of the broken bridge created an obstruction that caused the river to overflow its
banks, and it was buried under the sand and mud of the river.
There was also a prophecy: If a rock carved like a totem pole that stood beside the bridge became buried,
then the nation of Korea would fall, but if that rock was clearly exposed to the people, then a new heaven
and earth would unfold in Korea. (455-261, 2004/06/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for Chinese envoys to travel to the seat of Korea's government, they had to cross the Dallae
River at Jeongju. However there was no bridge for them to cross, and at that time the government did not
have money to build one. So the government posted a bulletin, seeking someone to build a bridge there.
That is when Jo Han-jun, my maternal grandmother's ancestor, built the bridge with his personal wealth.
He made it a large stone bridge under which boats could pass.
When Jo Han-jun finished building the bridge, he had but three coins remaining to his name. He used
those three coins to buy straw sandals to wear to the dedication ceremony the following day. Afterward he
went to sleep, and that night he had a dream. An old man clothed in white appeared and said, "Han-jun,
you offered distinguished service to your nation, and as a reward I wanted to send the son of heaven to
your family. However, when you used those three coins for yourself, you did not completely fulfill
heavens condition, so I will send you the princess of heaven instead." He woke up from that dream and
ran to the Dallae River. There on a hill above the river he found that a stone statue of the Maitreya
Buddha had appeared. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to legend, when the people saw the stone Maitreya standing on the hill, they thought it had
sprung up from underneath the ground. They built an open shrine for the statue so that it would not be
exposed to the elements. Then the Maitreya statue began to grow. It grew bigger and bigger until it
pierced the roof of the shrine, and the shrine had to be rebuilt. Then, strangely enough, the statues belly
began to bulge, and when it did, so did the bellies of all the daughters in the Jo clan. This caused a big
misunderstanding among the villagers, who thought that the unmarried girls had become pregnant out of
wedlock.
Then, the Jo family cut off the stone statue's stomach to flatten it, but after that it began to bleed from its
stomach. The mystical bleeding statue frightened them, so the Jo family quickly covered it with plaster to
block the bleeding. Another local legend is that whenever someone passed by that statue on a horse, if the
rider did not dismount and pay respect to the statue, the horse's shoes would stick to the ground and it
could not move forward. Through such miracles as these, heaven raised the faithful Jo clan and sent my
maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo. God began preparing the spiritual environment starting with my
ancestor Jo Han-jun and then connected that foundation to me. (True Mother, 2012/12/25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Mothers maternal grandmothers' family name is Jo. Her family lived in a wealthy village, a
community of tile-roofed houses where many government officials lived. True Mother's maternal
grandmother, the third generation of her ancestral line, was a direct descendant of Jo Han-jun. Coming
out of such a meritorious family tradition, both her maternal grandmother and Daemonim greatly loved
True Mother and devoted special attention to raising her. Since Daemonim was often traveling all over
the nation looking for the Lord, it was Grandmother Jo who actually raised True Mother. This family
wanted more than anyone else to know all the secrets about the spirit world. (573-262, 2007/08/24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hong Yu-il, my maternal grandfather, was tall and handsome. When I first met True Father, he felt
familiar to me because he looked so much like my grandfather. In those days my grandfather was so open
to modern trends that he even bought high-heeled shoes for his daughter-in-law. Jo Won-mo, my maternal
grandmother, was petite and pretty. She was diligent and active. Although she was not well educated, she
was very much a modern lady. She even operated her own business selling and repairing sewing
machines. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cultural-preparation">Cultural preparation</h3>
<p>True Mothers ancestral home is located in South Korea, in Cheongju, North Chungcheong
Province. According to Father's explanation, Chungcheong means "a pure heart and a clear
mind" and Cheongju means "a village that is clear and pure." When river or ocean water is
clear, we can see fish and other things deep in the water. Likewise, Cheongju signifies a village of
people whose hearts are pure and minds are clear, who seek to become the people of the Way.
True Mother's family name Han, comes from the Cheongju Han clan, and it represents Korea, the
Han nation, Hanguk. In addition, it represents the universe, since Han also signifies hana,
meaning the first, or number one. That is why God prepared Heaven's Bride with the name Han
from the Cheongju Han clan.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Korea has 4,300 years of history. This history includes the era of Gojoseon. The Korean people were
called the Dongyi people, a people in the East who studied astronomy and interpreted the stars to
ascertain heavenly fortune. In every era of its history Korea has upheld a national religion. In the eras of
Silla and Goryeo, it was Buddhism, and in the era of Joseon, it was Confucianism. When we trace back to
the earliest history of Korea, we find a record that the Han clan preceded even the Gojoseon era. There we
can find the origin of the Korean people, from a time even earlier than the Gojoseon era. (615-173,
2009/08/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Korean historians state that before the Gojoseon era there was a nation governed by Emperor Hwan-
ung. It was he who begat Dangun, the first ancestor of Korea.
The word hwan is an old pronunciation of the word that in subsequent Korean history came to be written
han. That is why people often refer to Hwan-ung by the name Han-ung. Of course, some people disparage
this part of Korean history as mere mythology. However, hidden in the myth of Dan-gun is God's Will to
choose the Han people as the people of heaven's lineage. Artifacts and related data associated with that
era are being discovered, and they are proving that the mythology has a basis in fact.<br />
Not many people know the origin of the word Han in the phrase "the Han people" or in the official name
of Korea, Daehan Minguk. But in fact, the origin of this word can be found in the name "Han Clan
Joseon." Thousands of years ago a vast territory that stretched from the northeastern part of China to the
Korean Peninsula was ruled by members of the Han lineage; thus that nation was called Han Clan Joseon.
The reason that we Korean people are often called the Han people and that our nation's name is Daehan
Minguk originates from the Han Clan Joseon nation of long ago. Ultimately, what this means is that our
nation was established by the ancient ancestors of the Han people. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we search for the root of the phrase "the Han people," we find that it originates from han. This
word denotes the unique name that our people were called from ancient times. It means the first people
and a great people. It also refers to the people of heaven's lineage who will fulfill God's Will and make the
world one. Therefore, the Han clan is known to be a royal and prestigious lineage with a long and
enduring history. That is why it was from this lineage that God sought a woman to be the True Mother.
(True Mother, 2013/12/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Han also is the word for the One, God, and the oneness of all things in the universe. In addition, it
means vast, which implies embracing everything in the universe, fully and abundantly. It also means
divine, number one in the world, and the origin or beginning of all things. Thus, we Han people are the
people who will carry out the role of fulfilling God's Will on earth by spearheading human history and
guiding humankind to truth. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We Korean people are known as the Baedal people, the white-clothed people. Baedal means "the
bright country," and "the country that reveres heaven." Dan-gun is also called the King of Baedal, an
ancient kingdom of the Korean people thousands of years ago. From the Bible, we read that God chose
Noah and Abraham, and worked with them as central figures to prepare the Israelites as the chosen people
to whom He would eventually send Jesus. Likewise, heaven chose the Han people as the people of
heaven's lineage and raised them as His people with the Hongik Ingan teaching -- the principle to widely
benefit humankind -- that was given by Dangun. Thus God prepared them to lead the providence when He
sends the Returning Lord to them. Therefore, we must bear in mind that the Han people have been chosen
by God to stand in front and lead the way to establish the kingdom of peace in the Era After the Coming
of Heaven. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Korean alphabet was revealed during the reign of King Sejong, who promulgated it as Hunmin
Jeongeum, meaning "the teaching of correct sounds for the people." The name can be interpreted to mean
that those who teach and learn what is right will continue on, even if their country falls into ruin. I came
to learn that the Dongyi people (another name for the Korean people) have such a history and character.
It is generally believed that Korean history spans approximately 4,000 years, beginning with the Gojoseon
era. However, the Han people already existed 3,000 years prior to the Gojoseon era, and their place of
origin on the Korean Peninsula was Cheongju. I am now working to systematically organize all the
material that I have compiled and publish a book about the ancient history of Korea, one that does not
treat Korea in isolation but demonstrates its links with the history of other Far Eastern nations. (613-043,

<h2 id="section-3-spirit-led-churches">Section 3. Spirit-led Churches</h2>
<h2 id="the-providence-of-spirit-led-churches">The providence of Spirit-led churches</h2>
<p>Beginning around 1900, while God was initiating the providence to send the returning Messiah to
the land of Korea, Spirit-led churches began to emerge. These were led by devout Christians who
had advance knowledge about the providence of God. The work of these churches began with the
New Jesus Church led by Rev. Yi Yong- do, was passed to the Holy Lord Church of Rev. Kim
Seong-do, and culminated with the Inside the Womb Church of Rev. Heo Ho-bin. As these
churches searched for the Returning Lord, they also created the foundation for God's providence
to welcome Heavens Bride.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the land of Korea, God has been conducting spiritual work focusing on Christianity. Focusing on
certain spiritual Christian churches God prepared a foundation in the 1930s and 1940s before Korea's
liberation from Japan. Those Christian churches had to understand God's internal circumstances and
attend His internal Will, to prepare to receive the Returning Lord. God led this work through numerous
families and pioneers. In Cheolsan, Pyongyang and Wonsan they did everything they could to prepare a
good environment for the time of the Lord's return. Since Christianity was called to fulfill the Will to
receive the Lord, God had these faithful believers prepare a spiritual environment to receive him. (028-
058, 1970/01/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among people doing this spiritual work was Rev. Kim Seong-do, who lived in Cheolsan. Another
spiritual leader at that time was Rev. Baek Nam-ju from Hamheung, who was granted authorization by
the Japanese governor-general's office in Korea to lead the Holy Lord Church. This was possible only
because of guidance from the spirit world. The spirit world gave a message to Rev. Baek to walk barefoot
from Hamheung to Cheolsan and meet Rev. Kim. Although the distance was some 240 to 280 kilometers,
he walked barefoot and met Rev. Kim. In this way, east and west united.
God prepared this foundation of unity so that the Returning Lord would not be persecuted when he
arrived. That is how the Holy Lord (Seongju) Church was formed. Its name takes seong, meaning "holy,"
from Kim Seong-do, and ju, meaning "the Lord," from Baek Nam-ju. However, a problem arose: Kim
Seong-do viewed her position as higher than that of Baek Nam-ju and others. Kim Seong-do said, "Since
I am the one whom heaven taught about Eve's mission, I am the one who must attend the Lord when He
comes." (223-211, 1991/11/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Rev. Kim Seong-do and her family failed to fulfill their responsibility for her mission, it was
transferred to a woman who faithfully attended her, Rev. Heo Ho-bin. Rev. Heo's whole life was focused
on the Returning Lord. Heaven taught her how sin could be removed, how to live a daily life of
attendance to the Lord, and how children should be raised after the Lord's coming. Rev. Heo set up all the
necessary traditions for living in attendance to the Returning Lord. Rev. Heo had to make these
preparations before Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945. The Principle of Restoration is such that she
needed to do this work during the seven years prior to the liberation. Then, God's plan for the Returning
Lord could have been fulfilled at the time of the liberation. The Messiah could have inherited the
foundation she had built and initiated a new history.
Rev. Heo stood one level lower than the Returning Lord. She did not stand in the same position as the
Lord; rather she stood in the position of symbolically giving birth to him. Through her, the Lord could be
born symbolically, this is according to the Principle of Restoration. Thus her mission symbolized that of
Mary. (008-223, 1960/01/06)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two thousand years ago in Israel, God made many preparations before the birth of Jesus. He prepared
the people of Israel ahead of time to welcome Jesus. He prepared so that Jesus could have his heavenly
family, unite the nation and then bring salvation to the world. However, the central figures of the
providence at that time cared more about their daily lives than about God's circumstances or His profound
Will. As a result of their not recognizing and attending Jesus properly, Jesus was sent to the cross. During
the 2,000 years since Jesus' resurrection, God has been working through Christian culture to awaken and
prepare people as brides to attend the Returning Lord. He called Korea to be His chosen nation.
Although Korea has but a short history of Christianity, God led the people of Korea to establish churches
to make internal preparations to welcome the Returning Lord both before and after the country's
liberation. God directly guided Rev. Heo Ho-bin and her husband, who established the Inside the Womb
Church, to make internal preparations to attend the Returning Lord. This included making clothes that
would fit him for every year of his life from birth to age 33.<br />
This was to alleviate the bitter sorrow of Jesus, whose life of 33 years was so miserable. (True Mother,
1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="nurturing-true-mother">Nurturing True Mother</h3>
<p>True Father said, "The Holy Lord Church led by Rev. Kim Seong-do and the Inside the Womb
Church led by Rev. Heo Ho-bin were connected to True Mother through Daemonim." Throughout
her life, Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim) made many conditions of devotion to meet the Returning
Lord. Also, when she joined the Holy Lord Church and the Inside the Womb Church, she
dedicated herself to these churches. During that time, Rev. Heo's mother gave a blessing to True
Mother, "You will be Heaven's Bride." This signified that the entire foundation of the conditions
of devotion made by all these Spirit-led churches was bequeathed to True Mother through
Daemonim.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As no tree is without roots, we need to understand the people in the past who constituted the roots of
True Father and True Mother before they were inaugurated as the True Parents. It is significant that they
created and maintained a good environment, good family and good lineage until the end of their lives. My
mother, Daemonim, was born on the 22nd day of the 2nd lunar month in 1914, at Jeongju, North
Pyeongan Province. She devoted her life completely to finding the Returning Lord and then lived her
whole life in attendance to him. Christians up to that time lived with the hope of welcoming the Lord, but
my mother's path was different. In order to meet the Lord she actively searched for him, rather than just
hoping and waiting for him to come. (True Mother, 1989/12/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thousands of years before Jesus came, God made many preparations for Israel to receive him that
remain unknown to this day. In Korea as well, prior to the liberation He prepared many groups to receive
the Lord at his return. Those groups carried out internal work for the providential history of restoration.
My maternal grandmother and my mother searched everywhere for those groups. They lived their lives
only for the Will, preparing for the day when they could meet the Lord. In the end, their sincere and
devout life of faith led me to where I am today. Living a virtuous and pure life, they separated themselves
from anything impure or evil. I learned this way of life primarily from my mother, but my maternal
grandmother also greatly influenced me. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grandmother Jo Won-mo was born in a Christian family. She had deep faith and love for her country,
and was passionate about everything she did. With the explosive beginning of the March 1st Movement in
1919, she participated while carrying my mother, who was then five, on her back. I remember one time
seeing a picture of her at a rally. Grandmother Jo was truly a remarkable woman, with a fervent life of
faith that influenced my mother. They attended a Presbyterian Church until my mother was 19 years old.
Later, they attended the Holy Lord Church founded by Rev. Kim Seong-do, even making the long journey
to Cheolsan to attend a church there because it was very active. My grandmother and my mother joined
that church and continued their life of faith. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1944, one year after I was born, my mother and grandmother Jo Won-mo joined the Inside the
Womb Church, where preparations were being made to attend the Returning Lord. Rev. Heo Ho-bin told
the members, "Each and every woman in the church should make at least one set of clothes for the Lord.
Otherwise, when he comes you will be ashamed."
One afternoon, around 1:00 p.m., Rev. Heo asked my mother to make a set of clothes for the Lord and
complete them before nightfall. It might be possible to make clothes for an ordinary person within several
hours, but making clothes for the Lord required extra special care. Still, my mother obeyed and did her
best. With trembling hands, she made the clothes with a heart of gratitude.<br />
My mother wanted to be like Rev. Heo, who was living a spiritual life of attendance to the Returning
Lord day and night. One day she thought to herself, "If only I could meet the Lord once, even in a dream,
I could die and have no regrets." That night she had a dream. In her dream, she was wearing a white
Korean dress. She was in a clean three-room house with a thatched roof. Having prepared breakfast, she
was coming out of the kitchen, drying her hands on her apron, when Grandmother Jo said, "Not just
anyone is allowed to come into this room." Still, she opened the door, and without saying anything,
quietly entered the room and sat down. There she saw a man, physically well built and wearing a
headband, sitting at the table facing the east and studying. All of a sudden he turned around and looked at
her, and said, "I have been studying hard in order to find you."<br />
My mother later said that his remark touched her deeply and she was overwhelmed with gratitude, but at
the same time she felt inadequate and could only shed tears, unable to utter even one word. She wept
while holding his hand. Then she woke up. After waking up, she thought, "What an unusual dream! He
must be the Returning Lord." That is how my mother had her first encounter with True Father, in a dream.
(True Mother, 2014/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One day, Rev. Heo Ho-bin told my mother about a revelation that she had received. "I was told that
you should go to Anju and buy new shoes for the Returning Lord and his Bride, and also a traditional
Korean hat for him." My mother departed as soon as she heard this. She went to a well-known craftsman
who made those items and asked him sincerely, "Please make them with your utmost devotion. I will pay
you as much money as you want. Just make them to the best of your ability." She gave him the sizes for
the items and left. One week later, my mother went to pick up the items. She was pleased with the shoes
but not with the hat. As soon as the craftsman handed her the hat, she felt her arms starting to get numb
and saw the sky turning yellow. Her entire body was paralyzed, she could not move at all, and her feet
were stuck to the floor. When she said to the craftsman, "You must make it again," little by little her body
returned to its normal state. My mother was very upset, and she scolded him for not making it properly.
He was shaken, and he promised to try his best to make it right.<br />
A week later, she went back to that craftsman. This time she was well pleased with the hat. She was
relieved by this and, after paying for the shoes and hat, brought them back to the church in Pyongyang.
Later when she shared her experience about the incident, Rev. Heo laughed with joy.<br />
After about a month, my mother had another dream. She used to have very vivid dreams. In this dream
the same man whom she had seen in her dream the previous month appeared again and said, "I need to go
to the North and study more. So prepare your favorite sleeping pad and blanket; also a suit of clothes. Put
them in my backpack for me to carry with me." She answered that she would do so, and returned home.
Still in the dream, she entered her house, and amazingly, a clean blanket and sleeping pad were already
prepared and waiting for her. There was even a suit of clothes; it was light-colored and the fabric was of
excellent quality. Thinking, "How incredible! How can I ever express my gratitude enough?" she packed
them in a backpack with wholehearted devotion and offered it to the man.<br />
As he put it on his back, he said to her, "I will be back in three years. During that time, do not change
your heart. Just wait for me!" He whistled a tune as he departed on his solitary journey. As she watched
his back receding into the distance, my mother cried and cried. He looked so lonely as he departed to
study in the North. She thought to herself, "Of course, my heart will not change. Although I am just an
ordinary woman, this distinguished man sincerely requested that I not change my heart for three years."
She was so overwhelmed by his loving heart toward her that she could not stop crying. Then she woke up.
In this way my mother, Daemonim, met the Returning Lord ahead of time, in her dreams. (True Mother,
2014/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In August 1946, one of the Inside the Womb Church members defected to the communist authorities.
Rev. Heo Ho-bin and other Inside the Womb Church leaders were arrested by the police and imprisoned
at the Daedong Detention Center. During the interrogation, whenever they asked Rev. Heo, "When will
the baby Jesus be born?" she kept on saying, "In a few days." That was what the messages from heaven
had told her to say.<br />
She had told the members of her church that the Lord of the Second Advent would be released from the
prison, so every day about 20 to 30 members of her church clad in white clothes waited for the Lord
outside the jail. In the meantime, internal security officers confiscated all the clothes that had been made
for the Returning Lord over many years. Hence, heaven gave a message to the church members that they
had to make them all again. It took them an entire year to make the clothes, yet even by then, Rev. Heo
had not yet been released. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometime in June of 1946, Father left Seoul and went to Pyongyang in the North. He evangelized
there and found a lecture room in Gyeongchang-ri where he could meet his followers. Around that time
the communist authorities began to persecute religious groups. Rev. Heo Ho-bin and her main church
leaders were incarcerated at the Daedong Detention Center, charged with operating a pseudo-religion.
Father was incarcerated at the same facility. He was charged with two counts: leading a pseudo-religion,
similar to the charge against Rev. Heo, and being a spy for South Korean President Syngman Rhee.<br />
The Inside the Womb Church was prepared in the position of the providential Bride, but it failed to come
to True Father, who was in the position of the Bridegroom. From inside the prison Father twice sent
messengers to Rev. Heo to let her know who he was, but she rejected those messages. Yet even in the
prison God continued to work to bring her to Father. Father was imprisoned for 100 days, beginning on
August 11. During that time he attempted to contact Rev. Heo Ho-bin several times, but she never
recognized who Father was, even to the very end of her life. She rejected God's providential efforts to
approach her and His loving heart to spare her life and ended up going the way of faithlessness and death.<br />
On November 21, Father was thrown out of the prison, on the verge of death due to the severe torture he
had undergone in the prison, and he survived thanks to God's grace. The other leaders of the Inside the
Womb Church were also tortured at that time. All of them were later executed, sometime after the Korean
War began. This is a living lesson given to us from history: how severe and tragic the fate that befalls
those who are called to a providential mission should they fail to fulfill the responsibility for which
heaven has blessed them and showered them with grace. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mother, Daemonim, and my maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo, lived their entire lives with faith
in order to receive the Returning Lord. They never compromised; they never settled into a comfortable
family life. Instead, they totally immersed themselves in serving God with their utmost devotion. Since
my mother walked a path of trials and tribulations in order to receive the Returning Lord, I naturally
participated in doing so along with her. My grandmother, mother and I would sacrifice anything for the
way of the Will. That is why God was continually with our family. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we see from the life of my mother, Hong Soon-ae, we should live a life of which we can be proud.
Out of the four persons who are parents of the True Parents, my mother is the only one who attended True
Father until the end. For this reason True Father bestowed on her the title Daemonim. Before she received
this title, she offered endless prayers, shedding tears of anguish. Her sincere devotion was a devotion that
heaven alone could understand. Before she met True Father, she prayed that God would guide her to meet
the Returning Lord. After she met True Father, she prayed even more deeply for the entire True Family,
because she was well aware how hard Satan was trying to invade the True Family spiritually. She fought
with Satan to protect the True Family; in fact, she kept on praying for them even during the ten years
when she was suffering from failing health. (True Mother, 1989/12/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From now on none of you should accumulate wealth for yourself. It is good to be frugal, but I suggest
that you be frugal so that you can make a greater offering for the Will. You should be able to invest all
your savings for your clan, for your nation, and for the reunification of Korea. Do not think only of your
own family. The only thing you need is a heart burning with love for God. Like Daemonim, you should
live 24 hours a day thinking only of how you will fulfill the Will of God and True Parents. She had
nothing else in her heart but that; she did not think of anything else. Because of this she deserves our
utmost respect. That is why I bestowed on her the title Daemo, "Great Mother." (208-346, 1990/11/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After True Parents' Holy Wedding, Daemonim and True Mother had to work hard to deal with
criticism from all kinds of women, ranging from the wife of the laborer to a lady from the line of the royal
family. Mother could not endure this all by herself; three generations -- grandmother Jo Won-mo,
Daemonim and True Mother -- had to face it together. Knowing Daemonim had fulfilled her
responsibility in this, I gave her the title Daemo, which means "Great Mother."<br />
The way of love that all women have to walk has high walls to overcome. Unless True Mother could take
those walls down, women would come to blame her. Daemonim appealed to God, crying out that she
could take all True Mother's burdens on her behalf, and she actually did so. She also ardently prayed that
she could dissolve all the worries, bitterness and sorrows of the True Family.<br />
Now, having passed through the painful path of sacrifices, we have come to the era when we can go over
the national level and even the world level and proceed toward the world of unity and liberation. Hong
Soon-ae truly accomplished all her responsibilities; hence, she deserves to be attended by all. That is why
I named her Daemonim.<br />
As an example to your families and descendants, all of you should inherit Daemonim's heart of single-
minded loyalty and establish a proper tradition of attending God. This grandmother lived only to attend
God. In attending God in your families you should fulfill the way of a loyal heart with single-mindedness
even greater than hers. On November 4, 1989, in honor of Daemonim, I created a calligraphic tribute,
Chungshim Bong-shin which means "with a loyal heart she dedicated herself" to God and True Parents.
Anyone, like her, who goes to the spirit world after a life of sacrifice lived with single-minded devotion
will open the gate to receive blessings from God free from any accusation. (195-152, 1989/11/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daemonim's entire life of faith and devotion had only one objective. We must especially remember
that from the beginning she was part of the new providential work that included proclaiming that the
Returning Lord would be born on earth as a human being. She participated in the new churches that God
created for that purpose. Rev. Kim Seong-do, founder of the Holy Lord Church, was the first generation;
another line was represented by Rev. Heo Ho-bin of the Inside the Womb Church. Their work laid the
foundation that was bequeathed to True Mother. They formed the mainstream history from which
Daemonim inherited the tradition of faith; but she was the first of these forerunners to actually attend the
Returning Lord.<br />
By giving birth to True Mother, she completed the work of these women who had labored through three
generations to carry out the role of Eve. She made preparations discreetly, knowing that the Will would
bear fruit in True Mothers generation. Words cannot describe all the hardships she endured. The many
ordeals she had to bear throughout her life are beyond description. No one, not her siblings, her relatives
or her friends, was ever able to understand her. As she walked her lonely path of faith, she even subsisted
on raw pine needles. Yet her belief never changed and her faith never wavered as she established the
foundation for True Mother to meet me. (265-009, 1994/11/07)</p>
