## Chapter 2 True Mother's Birth 

### Section 3 Spirit-led Churches 

#### The providence of Spirit-led churches 
Beginning around 1900, while God was initiating the providence to send the returning Messiah to
the land of Korea, Spirit-led churches began to emerge. These were led by devout Christians who
had advance knowledge about the providence of God. The work of these churches began with the
New Jesus Church led by Rev. Yi Yong-do, was passed to the Holy Lord Church of Rev. Kim
Seong-do, and culminated with the Inside the Womb Church of Rev. Heo Ho-bin. As these
churches searched for the Returning Lord, they also created the foundation for God's providence
to welcome Heavens Bride.
1. In the land of Korea, God has been conducting spiritual work focusing on Christianity. Focusing on
certain spiritual Christian churches God prepared a foundation in the 1930s and 1940s before Korea's
liberation from Japan. Those Christian churches had to understand God's internal circumstances and
attend His internal Will, to prepare to receive the Returning Lord. God led this work through numerous
families and pioneers. In Cheolsan, Pyongyang and Wonsan they did everything they could to prepare a
good environment for the time of the Lord's return. Since Christianity was called to fulfill the Will to
receive the Lord, God had these faithful believers prepare a spiritual environment to receive him. (028-
058, 1970/01/03)
2. Among people doing this spiritual work was Rev. Kim Seong-do, who lived in Cheolsan. Another
spiritual leader at that time was Rev. Baek Nam-ju from Hamheung, who was granted authorization by
the Japanese governor-general's office in Korea to lead the Holy Lord Church. This was possible only
because of guidance from the spirit world. The spirit world gave a message to Rev. Baek to walk barefoot
from Hamheung to Cheolsan and meet Rev. Kim. Although the distance was some 240 to 280 kilometers,
he walked barefoot and met Rev. Kim. In this way, east and west united.
God prepared this foundation of unity so that the Returning Lord would not be persecuted when he
arrived. That is how the Holy Lord (Seongju) Church was formed. Its name takes seong, meaning "holy,"
from Kim Seong-do, and ju, meaning "the Lord," from Baek Nam-ju. However, a problem arose: Kim
Seong-do viewed her position as higher than that of Baek Nam-ju and others. Kim Seong-do said, "Since
I am the one whom heaven taught about Eve's mission, I am the one who must attend the Lord when He
comes." (223-211, 1991/11/10)
3. When Rev. Kim Seong-do and her family failed to fulfill their responsibility for her mission, it was
transferred to a woman who faithfully attended her, Rev. Heo Ho-bin. Rev. Heo's whole life was focused
on the Returning Lord. Heaven taught her how sin could be removed, how to live a daily life of
attendance to the Lord, and how children should be raised after the Lord's coming. Rev. Heo set up all the
necessary traditions for living in attendance to the Returning Lord. Rev. Heo had to make these
preparations before Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945. The Principle of Restoration is such that she
needed to do this work during the seven years prior to the liberation. Then, God's plan for the Returning
Lord could have been fulfilled at the time of the liberation. The Messiah could have inherited the
foundation she had built and initiated a new history.
Rev. Heo stood one level lower than the Returning Lord. She did not stand in the same position as the
Lord; rather she stood in the position of symbolically giving birth to him. Through her, the Lord could be
born symbolically, this is according to the Principle of Restoration. Thus her mission symbolized that of
Mary. (008-223, 1960/01/06)
4. Two thousand years ago in Israel, God made many preparations before the birth of Jesus. He prepared
the people of Israel ahead of time to welcome Jesus. He prepared so that Jesus could have his heavenly
family, unite the nation and then bring salvation to the world. However, the central figures of the
providence at that time cared more about their daily lives than about God's circumstances or His profound
Will. As a result of their not recognizing and attending Jesus properly, Jesus was sent to the cross. During
the 2,000 years since Jesus' resurrection, God has been working through Christian culture to awaken and
prepare people as brides to attend the Returning Lord. He called Korea to be His chosen nation.
Although Korea has but a short history of Christianity, God led the people of Korea to establish churches
to make internal preparations to welcome the Returning Lord both before and after the country's
liberation. God directly guided Rev. Heo Ho-bin and her husband, who established the Inside the Womb
Church, to make internal preparations to attend the Returning Lord. This included making clothes that
would fit him for every year of his life from birth to age 33.
This was to alleviate the bitter sorrow of Jesus, whose life of 33 years was so miserable. (True Mother,
1999/10/21) 

#### Nurturing True Mother 
True Father said, "The Holy Lord Church led by Rev. Kim Seong-do and the Inside the Womb
Church led by Rev. Heo Ho-bin were connected to True Mother through Daemonim." Throughout
her life, Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim) made many conditions of devotion to meet the Returning
Lord. Also, when she joined the Holy Lord Church and the Inside the Womb Church, she
dedicated herself to these churches. During that time, Rev. Heo's mother gave a blessing to True
Mother, "You will be Heaven's Bride." This signified that the entire foundation of the conditions
of devotion made by all these Spirit-led churches was bequeathed to True Mother through
Daemonim.
5. As no tree is without roots, we need to understand the people in the past who constituted the roots of
True Father and True Mother before they were inaugurated as the True Parents. It is significant that they
created and maintained a good environment, good family and good lineage until the end of their lives. My
mother, Daemonim, was born on the 22nd day of the 2nd lunar month in 1914, at Jeongju, North
Pyeongan Province. She devoted her life completely to finding the Returning Lord and then lived her
whole life in attendance to him. Christians up to that time lived with the hope of welcoming the Lord, but
my mother's path was different. In order to meet the Lord she actively searched for him, rather than just
hoping and waiting for him to come. (True Mother, 1989/12/02)
6. Thousands of years before Jesus came, God made many preparations for Israel to receive him that
remain unknown to this day. In Korea as well, prior to the liberation He prepared many groups to receive
the Lord at his return. Those groups carried out internal work for the providential history of restoration.
My maternal grandmother and my mother searched everywhere for those groups. They lived their lives
only for the Will, preparing for the day when they could meet the Lord. In the end, their sincere and
devout life of faith led me to where I am today. Living a virtuous and pure life, they separated themselves
from anything impure or evil. I learned this way of life primarily from my mother, but my maternal
grandmother also greatly influenced me. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
7. Grandmother Jo Won-mo was born in a Christian family. She had deep faith and love for her country,
and was passionate about everything she did. With the explosive beginning of the March 1st Movement in
1919, she participated while carrying my mother, who was then five, on her back. I remember one time
seeing a picture of her at a rally. Grandmother Jo was truly a remarkable woman, with a fervent life of
faith that influenced my mother. They attended a Presbyterian Church until my mother was 19 years old.
Later, they attended the Holy Lord Church founded by Rev. Kim Seong-do, even making the long journey
to Cheolsan to attend a church there because it was very active. My grandmother and my mother joined
that church and continued their life of faith. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
8. In 1944, one year after I was born, my mother and grandmother Jo Won-mo joined the Inside the
Womb Church, where preparations were being made to attend the Returning Lord. Rev. Heo Ho-bin told
the members, "Each and every woman in the church should make at least one set of clothes for the Lord.
Otherwise, when he comes you will be ashamed."
One afternoon, around 1:00 p.m., Rev. Heo asked my mother to make a set of clothes for the Lord and
complete them before nightfall. It might be possible to make clothes for an ordinary person within several
hours, but making clothes for the Lord required extra special care. Still, my mother obeyed and did her
best. With trembling hands, she made the clothes with a heart of gratitude.
My mother wanted to be like Rev. Heo, who was living a spiritual life of attendance to the Returning
Lord day and night. One day she thought to herself, "If only I could meet the Lord once, even in a dream,
I could die and have no regrets." That night she had a dream. In her dream, she was wearing a white
Korean dress. She was in a clean three-room house with a thatched roof. Having prepared breakfast, she
was coming out of the kitchen, drying her hands on her apron, when Grandmother Jo said, "Not just
anyone is allowed to come into this room." Still, she opened the door, and without saying anything,
quietly entered the room and sat down. There she saw a man, physically well built and wearing a
headband, sitting at the table facing the east and studying. All of a sudden he turned around and looked at
her, and said, "I have been studying hard in order to find you."
My mother later said that his remark touched her deeply and she was overwhelmed with gratitude, but at
the same time she felt inadequate and could only shed tears, unable to utter even one word. She wept
while holding his hand. Then she woke up. After waking up, she thought, "What an unusual dream! He
must be the Returning Lord." That is how my mother had her first encounter with True Father, in a dream.
(True Mother, 2014/10/11)
9. One day, Rev. Heo Ho-bin told my mother about a revelation that she had received. "I was told that
you should go to Anju and buy new shoes for the Returning Lord and his Bride, and also a traditional
Korean hat for him." My mother departed as soon as she heard this. She went to a well-known craftsman
who made those items and asked him sincerely, "Please make them with your utmost devotion. I will pay
you as much money as you want. Just make them to the best of your ability." She gave him the sizes for
the items and left. One week later, my mother went to pick up the items. She was pleased with the shoes
but not with the hat. As soon as the craftsman handed her the hat, she felt her arms starting to get numb
and saw the sky turning yellow. Her entire body was paralyzed, she could not move at all, and her feet
were stuck to the floor. When she said to the craftsman, "You must make it again," little by little her body
returned to its normal state. My mother was very upset, and she scolded him for not making it properly.
He was shaken, and he promised to try his best to make it right.
A week later, she went back to that craftsman. This time she was well pleased with the hat. She was
relieved by this and, after paying for the shoes and hat, brought them back to the church in Pyongyang.
Later when she shared her experience about the incident, Rev. Heo laughed with joy.
After about a month, my mother had another dream. She used to have very vivid dreams. In this dream
the same man whom she had seen in her dream the previous month appeared again and said, "I need to go
to the North and study more. So prepare your favorite sleeping pad and blanket; also a suit of clothes. Put
them in my backpack for me to carry with me." She answered that she would do so, and returned home.
Still in the dream, she entered her house, and amazingly, a clean blanket and sleeping pad were already
prepared and waiting for her. There was even a suit of clothes; it was light-colored and the fabric was of
excellent quality. Thinking, "How incredible! How can I ever express my gratitude enough?" she packed
them in a backpack with wholehearted devotion and offered it to the man.
As he put it on his back, he said to her, "I will be back in three years. During that time, do not change
your heart. Just wait for me!" He whistled a tune as he departed on his solitary journey. As she watched
his back receding into the distance, my mother cried and cried. He looked so lonely as he departed to
study in the North. She thought to herself, "Of course, my heart will not change. Although I am just an
ordinary woman, this distinguished man sincerely requested that I not change my heart for three years."
She was so overwhelmed by his loving heart toward her that she could not stop crying. Then she woke up.
In this way my mother, Daemonim, met the Returning Lord ahead of time, in her dreams. (True Mother,
2014/10/11)
10. In August 1946, one of the Inside the Womb Church members defected to the communist authorities.
Rev. Heo Ho-bin and other Inside the Womb Church leaders were arrested by the police and imprisoned
at the Daedong Detention Center. During the interrogation, whenever they asked Rev. Heo, "When will
the baby Jesus be born?" she kept on saying, "In a few days." That was what the messages from heaven
had told her to say.
She had told the members of her church that the Lord of the Second Advent would be released from the
prison, so every day about 20 to 30 members of her church clad in white clothes waited for the Lord
outside the jail. In the meantime, internal security officers confiscated all the clothes that had been made
for the Returning Lord over many years. Hence, heaven gave a message to the church members that they
had to make them all again. It took them an entire year to make the clothes, yet even by then, Rev. Heo
had not yet been released. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
11. Sometime in June of 1946, Father left Seoul and went to Pyongyang in the North. He evangelized
there and found a lecture room in Gyeongchang-ri where he could meet his followers. Around that time
the communist authorities began to persecute religious groups. Rev. Heo Ho-bin and her main church
leaders were incarcerated at the Daedong Detention Center, charged with operating a pseudo-religion.
Father was incarcerated at the same facility. He was charged with two counts: leading a pseudo-religion,
similar to the charge against Rev. Heo, and being a spy for South Korean President Syngman Rhee.
The Inside the Womb Church was prepared in the position of the providential Bride, but it failed to come
to True Father, who was in the position of the Bridegroom. From inside the prison Father twice sent
messengers to Rev. Heo to let her know who he was, but she rejected those messages. Yet even in the
prison God continued to work to bring her to Father. Father was imprisoned for 100 days, beginning on
August 11. During that time he attempted to contact Rev. Heo Ho-bin several times, but she never
recognized who Father was, even to the very end of her life. She rejected God's providential efforts to
approach her and His loving heart to spare her life and ended up going the way of faithlessness and death.
On November 21, Father was thrown out of the prison, on the verge of death due to the severe torture he
had undergone in the prison, and he survived thanks to God's grace. The other leaders of the Inside the
Womb Church were also tortured at that time. All of them were later executed, sometime after the Korean
War began. This is a living lesson given to us from history: how severe and tragic the fate that befalls
those who are called to a providential mission should they fail to fulfill the responsibility for which
heaven has blessed them and showered them with grace. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
12. My mother, Daemonim, and my maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo, lived their entire lives with faith
in order to receive the Returning Lord. They never compromised; they never settled into a comfortable
family life. Instead, they totally immersed themselves in serving God with their utmost devotion. Since
my mother walked a path of trials and tribulations in order to receive the Returning Lord, I naturally
participated in doing so along with her. My grandmother, mother and I would sacrifice anything for the
way of the Will. That is why God was continually with our family. (True Mother, 2014/10/11)
13. As we see from the life of my mother, Hong Soon-ae, we should live a life of which we can be proud.
Out of the four persons who are parents of the True Parents, my mother is the only one who attended True
Father until the end. For this reason True Father bestowed on her the title Daemonim. Before she received
this title, she offered endless prayers, shedding tears of anguish. Her sincere devotion was a devotion that
heaven alone could understand. Before she met True Father, she prayed that God would guide her to meet
the Returning Lord. After she met True Father, she prayed even more deeply for the entire True Family,
because she was well aware how hard Satan was trying to invade the True Family spiritually. She fought
with Satan to protect the True Family; in fact, she kept on praying for them even during the ten years
when she was suffering from failing health. (True Mother, 1989/12/02)
14. From now on none of you should accumulate wealth for yourself. It is good to be frugal, but I suggest
that you be frugal so that you can make a greater offering for the Will. You should be able to invest all
your savings for your clan, for your nation, and for the reunification of Korea. Do not think only of your
own family. The only thing you need is a heart burning with love for God. Like Daemonim, you should
live 24 hours a day thinking only of how you will fulfill the Will of God and True Parents. She had
nothing else in her heart but that; she did not think of anything else. Because of this she deserves our
utmost respect. That is why I bestowed on her the title Daemo, "Great Mother." (208-346, 1990/11/21)
15. After True Parents' Holy Wedding, Daemonim and True Mother had to work hard to deal with
criticism from all kinds of women, ranging from the wife of the laborer to a lady from the line of the royal
family. Mother could not endure this all by herself; three generations -- grandmother Jo Won-mo,
Daemonim and True Mother -- had to face it together. Knowing Daemonim had fulfilled her
responsibility in this, I gave her the title Daemo, which means "Great Mother."
The way of love that all women have to walk has high walls to overcome. Unless True Mother could take
those walls down, women would come to blame her. Daemonim appealed to God, crying out that she
could take all True Mother's burdens on her behalf, and she actually did so. She also ardently prayed that
she could dissolve all the worries, bitterness and sorrows of the True Family.
Now, having passed through the painful path of sacrifices, we have come to the era when we can go over
the national level and even the world level and proceed toward the world of unity and liberation. Hong
Soon-ae truly accomplished all her responsibilities; hence, she deserves to be attended by all. That is why
I named her Daemonim.
As an example to your families and descendants, all of you should inherit Daemonim's heart of singleminded loyalty and establish a proper tradition of attending God. This grandmother lived only to attend
God. In attending God in your families you should fulfill the way of a loyal heart with single-mindedness
even greater than hers. On November 4, 1989, in honor of Daemonim, I created a calligraphic tribute,
Chungshim Bong-shin which means "with a loyal heart she dedicated herself" to God and True Parents.
Anyone, like her, who goes to the spirit world after a life of sacrifice lived with single-minded devotion
will open the gate to receive blessings from God free from any accusation. (195-152, 1989/11/07)
16. Daemonim's entire life of faith and devotion had only one objective. We must especially remember
that from the beginning she was part of the new providential work that included proclaiming that the
Returning Lord would be born on earth as a human being. She participated in the new churches that God
created for that purpose. Rev. Kim Seong-do, founder of the Holy Lord Church, was the first generation;
another line was represented by Rev. Heo Ho-bin of the Inside the Womb Church. Their work laid the
foundation that was bequeathed to True Mother. They formed the mainstream history from which
Daemonim inherited the tradition of faith; but she was the first of these forerunners to actually attend the
Returning Lord.
By giving birth to True Mother, she completed the work of these women who had labored through three
generations to carry out the role of Eve. She made preparations discreetly, knowing that the Will would
bear fruit in True Mothers generation. Words cannot describe all the hardships she endured. The many
ordeals she had to bear throughout her life are beyond description. No one, not her siblings, her relatives
or her friends, was ever able to understand her. As she walked her lonely path of faith, she even subsisted
on raw pine needles. Yet her belief never changed and her faith never wavered as she established the
foundation for True Mother to meet me. (265-009, 1994/11/07)
