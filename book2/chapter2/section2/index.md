## Chapter 2 True Mother's Birth 

### Section 2 True Mother's Family 

#### God's preparation
True Mother's father, Han Seung-oon, was born January 20, 1909, and died on March 18, 1978.
His father was Han Byeong-geon, his mother was Choi Gi-byeong, and he was the first son
among five siblings. In May 1946, while working as a schoolteacher, he fled to the South. After
that he worked as a teacher in elementary schools in Seoul and in Gyeonggi Province until
February 1974. He dedicated 41 years of his life to being a teacher, in both North and South
Korea.
Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim) was born on the 22nd day of the 2nd lunar month in 1914, into a
devout Christian family. Her father was Hong Yu-il. Her mother, Jo Won-mo (who lived from the
7th day of the 11th lunar month of 1889 to the 3rd day of the 9th lunar month of 1962), bore him
one son and one daughter. Daemonim was their first child. Jo Won-mo, True Mother's maternal
grandmother, was a diligent and active woman like contemporary women. It is known that one of
her ancestors, Jo Han-jun, built a significant stone bridge across the Dallae River at Jeongju in
North Pyeongan Province, investing his entire fortune to build it.
1. I was born at dawn on the 6th day of the 1st lunar month in 1943, at Anju, South Pyeongan Province. It
was not a remote village, yet there was a hill, and also a stream, right behind my house. The surrounding
village had a very warm and cozy feeling, like a hen embracing her chicks. In the backyard was a
cornfield that my family harvested for food. I remember how big those corncobs were. In the area
between True Father's hometown of Jeongju and my hometown of Anju there is a river. (True Mother,
1999/10/21)
2. My hometown, Anju, is in a strategic military and political location. It is one of the two important cities
that Pyeong-an Province was named for. The character pyeong is the first character of the city of
Pyongyang, and the character an is the first character of Anju. Anju is located in a natural environment of
expansive plains that are good for agriculture. Historians say that the town existed in the time before the
era called Gojoseon ("Ancient Joseon," 7th - 1st centuries BCE). The Cheongcheon River that flows
through this area separates North Pyeongan Province from South Pyeongan Province. Anju is about 60
kilometers from True Father's hometown of Jeongju and 75 kilometers from the city of Pyongyang.
During the time Daemonim was offering conditions of devotion every day and searching for new words
of truth, she would travel to the Holy Lord Church in Cheolsan, which was about 120 kilometers away.
(True Mother, 2013/12/06)
3. True Mother's maternal grandmother Jo Won-mo was a direct descendant of Jo Han-jun. The character
jo of her family name means nation. It signifies that Daemonim's mother was in the position of a mother
of the nation. That is the way the generations of her family tradition connected through history. Here is a
true story: After no one had repaired or maintained the Dallae Bridge in Jeongju for many decades, it
started to deteriorate. Eventually it reached the point that people could not cross the bridge, and the road
was blocked. Remnants of the broken bridge created an obstruction that caused the river to overflow its
banks, and it was buried under the sand and mud of the river.
There was also a prophecy: If a rock carved like a totem pole that stood beside the bridge became buried,
then the nation of Korea would fall, but if that rock was clearly exposed to the people, then a new heaven
and earth would unfold in Korea. (455-261, 2004/06/26)
4. In order for Chinese envoys to travel to the seat of Korea's government, they had to cross the Dallae
River at Jeongju. However there was no bridge for them to cross, and at that time the government did not
have money to build one. So the government posted a bulletin, seeking someone to build a bridge there.
That is when Jo Han-jun, my maternal grandmother's ancestor, built the bridge with his personal wealth.
He made it a large stone bridge under which boats could pass.
When Jo Han-jun finished building the bridge, he had but three coins remaining to his name. He used
those three coins to buy straw sandals to wear to the dedication ceremony the following day. Afterward he
went to sleep, and that night he had a dream. An old man clothed in white appeared and said, "Han-jun,
you offered distinguished service to your nation, and as a reward I wanted to send the son of heaven to
your family. However, when you used those three coins for yourself, you did not completely fulfill
heavens condition, so I will send you the princess of heaven instead." He woke up from that dream and
ran to the Dallae River. There on a hill above the river he found that a stone statue of the Maitreya
Buddha had appeared. (True Mother, 1999/10/21)
5. According to legend, when the people saw the stone Maitreya standing on the hill, they thought it had
sprung up from underneath the ground. They built an open shrine for the statue so that it would not be
exposed to the elements. Then the Maitreya statue began to grow. It grew bigger and bigger until it
pierced the roof of the shrine, and the shrine had to be rebuilt. Then, strangely enough, the statues belly
began to bulge, and when it did, so did the bellies of all the daughters in the Jo clan. This caused a big
misunderstanding among the villagers, who thought that the unmarried girls had become pregnant out of
wedlock.
Then, the Jo family cut off the stone statue's stomach to flatten it, but after that it began to bleed from its
stomach. The mystical bleeding statue frightened them, so the Jo family quickly covered it with plaster to
block the bleeding. Another local legend is that whenever someone passed by that statue on a horse, if the
rider did not dismount and pay respect to the statue, the horse's shoes would stick to the ground and it
could not move forward. Through such miracles as these, heaven raised the faithful Jo clan and sent my
maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo. God began preparing the spiritual environment starting with my
ancestor Jo Han-jun and then connected that foundation to me. (True Mother, 2012/12/25)
6. True Mothers maternal grandmothers' family name is Jo. Her family lived in a wealthy village, a
community of tile-roofed houses where many government officials lived. True Mother's maternal
grandmother, the third generation of her ancestral line, was a direct descendant of Jo Han-jun. Coming
out of such a meritorious family tradition, both her maternal grandmother and Daemonim greatly loved
True Mother and devoted special attention to raising her. Since Daemonim was often traveling all over
the nation looking for the Lord, it was Grandmother Jo who actually raised True Mother. This family
wanted more than anyone else to know all the secrets about the spirit world. (573-262, 2007/08/24)
7. Hong Yu-il, my maternal grandfather, was tall and handsome. When I first met True Father, he felt
familiar to me because he looked so much like my grandfather. In those days my grandfather was so open
to modern trends that he even bought high-heeled shoes for his daughter-in-law. Jo Won-mo, my maternal
grandmother, was petite and pretty. She was diligent and active. Although she was not well educated, she
was very much a modern lady. She even operated her own business selling and repairing sewing
machines. (True Mother, 1999/10/21) 

#### Cultural preparation 
True Mothers ancestral home is located in South Korea, in Cheongju, North Chungcheong
Province. According to Father's explanation, Chungcheong means "a pure heart and a clear
mind" and Cheongju means "a village that is clear and pure." When river or ocean water is
clear, we can see fish and other things deep in the water. Likewise, Cheongju signifies a village of
people whose hearts are pure and minds are clear, who seek to become the people of the Way.
True Mother's family name Han, comes from the Cheongju Han clan, and it represents Korea, the
Han nation, Hanguk. In addition, it represents the universe, since Han also signifies hana,
meaning the first, or number one. That is why God prepared Heaven's Bride with the name Han
from the Cheongju Han clan.
8. Korea has 4,300 years of history. This history includes the era of Gojoseon. The Korean people were
called the Dongyi people, a people in the East who studied astronomy and interpreted the stars to
ascertain heavenly fortune. In every era of its history Korea has upheld a national religion. In the eras of
Silla and Goryeo, it was Buddhism, and in the era of Joseon, it was Confucianism. When we trace back to
the earliest history of Korea, we find a record that the Han clan preceded even the Gojoseon era. There we
can find the origin of the Korean people, from a time even earlier than the Gojoseon era. (615-173,
2009/08/22)
9. Korean historians state that before the Gojoseon era there was a nation governed by Emperor Hwanung. It was he who begat Dangun, the first ancestor of Korea.
The word hwan is an old pronunciation of the word that in subsequent Korean history came to be written
han. That is why people often refer to Hwan-ung by the name Han-ung. Of course, some people disparage
this part of Korean history as mere mythology. However, hidden in the myth of Dan-gun is God's Will to
choose the Han people as the people of heaven's lineage. Artifacts and related data associated with that
era are being discovered, and they are proving that the mythology has a basis in fact.
Not many people know the origin of the word Han in the phrase "the Han people" or in the official name
of Korea, Daehan Minguk. But in fact, the origin of this word can be found in the name "Han Clan
Joseon." Thousands of years ago a vast territory that stretched from the northeastern part of China to the
Korean Peninsula was ruled by members of the Han lineage; thus that nation was called Han Clan Joseon.
The reason that we Korean people are often called the Han people and that our nation's name is Daehan
Minguk originates from the Han Clan Joseon nation of long ago. Ultimately, what this means is that our
nation was established by the ancient ancestors of the Han people. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
10. When we search for the root of the phrase "the Han people," we find that it originates from han. This
word denotes the unique name that our people were called from ancient times. It means the first people
and a great people. It also refers to the people of heaven's lineage who will fulfill God's Will and make the
world one. Therefore, the Han clan is known to be a royal and prestigious lineage with a long and
enduring history. That is why it was from this lineage that God sought a woman to be the True Mother.
(True Mother, 2013/12/06)
11. Han also is the word for the One, God, and the oneness of all things in the universe. In addition, it
means vast, which implies embracing everything in the universe, fully and abundantly. It also means
divine, number one in the world, and the origin or beginning of all things. Thus, we Han people are the
people who will carry out the role of fulfilling God's Will on earth by spearheading human history and
guiding humankind to truth. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
12. We Korean people are known as the Baedal people, the white-clothed people. Baedal means "the
bright country," and "the country that reveres heaven." Dan-gun is also called the King of Baedal, an
ancient kingdom of the Korean people thousands of years ago. From the Bible, we read that God chose
Noah and Abraham, and worked with them as central figures to prepare the Israelites as the chosen people
to whom He would eventually send Jesus. Likewise, heaven chose the Han people as the people of
heaven's lineage and raised them as His people with the Hongik Ingan teaching -- the principle to widely
benefit humankind -- that was given by Dangun. Thus God prepared them to lead the providence when He
sends the Returning Lord to them. Therefore, we must bear in mind that the Han people have been chosen
by God to stand in front and lead the way to establish the kingdom of peace in the Era After the Coming
of Heaven. (True Mother, 2013/12/06)
13. The Korean alphabet was revealed during the reign of King Sejong, who promulgated it as Hunmin
Jeongeum, meaning "the teaching of correct sounds for the people." The name can be interpreted to mean
that those who teach and learn what is right will continue on, even if their country falls into ruin. I came
to learn that the Dongyi people (another name for the Korean people) have such a history and character.
It is generally believed that Korean history spans approximately 4,000 years, beginning with the Gojoseon
era. However, the Han people already existed 3,000 years prior to the Gojoseon era, and their place of
origin on the Korean Peninsula was Cheongju. I am now working to systematically organize all the
material that I have compiled and publish a book about the ancient history of Korea, one that does not
treat Korea in isolation but demonstrates its links with the history of other Far Eastern nations. (613-043,
