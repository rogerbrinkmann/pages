## Chapter 1 True Father's Birth 

### Section 1 Background 

#### General background 
The country where God sent True Father as the Returning Lord suffered from natural disasters
that caused famine throughout the land during the years just prior to his birth. Internationally as
well, the entire world was in the midst of great chaos, manifesting signs of the Last Days. The
world was about to divide into two camps. The reason for such chaos, both within the country of
Korea and internationally, was the course of God's providence to establish national and
international foundations of indemnity for the birth of the Lord at his Second Advent.
True Father was born in Korea one year after the March 1st Independence Movement, on the 6th
day of the 1st lunar month (February 25) in 1920 at 2221 Sangsa village, in the Deokeon district
of the Jeongju township, North Pyeongan Province. His father was Moon Gyeong-yu, to whom
True Father later gave the title Chungbunim, meaning "Father of Loyalty." His mother was Kim
Gyeong-gye, to whom True Father later gave the title Chung-monim, meaning "Mother of
Loyalty." True Father was the second son among their six sons and seven daughters.
1. Originally, God intended that if Adam and Eve had not fallen, they would have become the True
Parents of humankind. As the True Parents, they would have understood God's heart and outlook, and
fully accomplished God's hope and purpose. However, due to the Fall, God's plan was frustrated. In order
to recover what was lost, the providence of re-creation was required.
Adam was re-created and reestablished in the position of the True Father of humankind when God placed
His hands on True Father's head and blessed him with the words, "You are Adam whom I made for the
ideal of creation! You are My Son who can fathom My situation and My heart!" The Lord of the Second
Advent is the person who came to earth with this responsibility. We can say that the purpose of the 6,000
years of human history was to establish that one person for whom God has sought -- the perfected
ancestor of humankind. (010-143, 1960/09/18)
2. Jesus died having been unable to entirely complete the Will of God. He established on earth a
relationship with God only at the adopted son level. Hence, God promised to send him to earth again. God
led the providence based on Christianity for 2,000 years in order to pioneer the way for the Lord to return
and establish the relationship of God's direct lineage. Therefore, Christians all over the world need to
engraft themselves directly onto God's beloved true Son.
With what qualification does the Lord come in the Last Days? He comes with the qualification to become
the True Parent. Although he comes again as the Messiah, he cannot come as the Lord of Glory. This is
because although Jesus came to earth, he was unable to rise to the position of the True Parent and thus
was unable in his lifetime to establish the foundation to comfort God by serving and attending Him in
glory representing all the peoples of the world.
The Messiah at his Second Coming must inherit the Will that Jesus could not fulfill on earth and fulfill it.
After completing this responsibility as a filial Son, he will be able to comfort God. On the foundation of
having completed the work of Jesus, he can be chosen as God's champion to subjugate even Satan. Once
he has done that, he will have built the basis to bring glory to God. In this way, he will acquire the
qualification to inaugurate the True Parents. This is a general overview of the providence of restoration
that God has been leading to this day. (017-074, 1966/11/12)
3. The era of war and chaos that began with the First World War continues to this day. This course of
history did not unfold simply by chance; it has been a course to pay indemnity for human history.
Intellectuals everywhere in the world say that we are now living in a world of radical change. The general
public thinks that these sudden changes are dangerous and could bring us to a world of despair. The
number of people who think that we will arrive at a world of hope is exceedingly small. Some even assert
that Western civilization, which has been leading the way in the modern world, is not only declining but
has already entered a world of darkness. They assert that not only is Christianity, the spiritual anchor of
Western civilization, in decline, but also that the families, societies and nations that are based upon
Christianity are declining as never before.
The young people of the world who are concerned about the future also cannot avoid agonizing over its
bleak situation. Such is the darkness and hopelessness of the era in which we live. Yet God does exist,
and He will not let them just keep running toward a final end full of despair. Rather, He confronts the
issues that beset us and works to connect the world to a new dimension, a place of hope. (103-039,
1979/02/02)
4. The 60 or 70 years following the First World War have been an era of global turmoil. In this historical
period, the world was destined to go through a course of great tribulations that were unavoidable. I was
born during this time and have faced severe trials to this day. In God's providence at this juncture in
human history, what is the purpose of this crucial period, an era full of suffering and turmoil? All
throughout history, whenever we human beings were in the midst of great hardships, we had to make a
choice: do we perish or do we revive? Indeed, in this period we are destined to make this same kind of
historic decision.
In this situation, our Heavenly Father will not leave humanity to go down a path to destruction. By
whatever means or method, He will save us. This period is the important time when God endeavors to
send to earth that special person who will be the standard-bearer of His providence. Therefore, despite all
kinds of hardships God has been pushing and pulling history to arrive at this point. At the same time, it is
certain that behind the scenes He has been laying the foundation for His new providence to advance and
prosper. (035-194, 1970/10/14)
5. In the East, Japan emerged, inheriting the providential mission of the island culture from Britain. At the
same time, Korea was linked providentially to the continental civilization that began with Rome, an
empire based in the Mediterranean that was to have received Jesus as the Messiah. Because the Returning
Lord was destined to come to the Adam nation of Korea, Korea had to endure a period of indemnity
before I was born. That is why it came under Japanese rule for 40 years. The year I was born, 1920, was
within this indemnity period. Because of that, my clan had to carry out the Will to finish all the historical
conditions of providential history. As a result, the members of my clan had to go through a course of
indemnity. (313-070, 1999/11/12)
6. The year 1920 when I was born was the year following the March 1st Movement for Korean
independence. Before my birth, Korea suffered three years of famine. The March 1st Movement brought
the nation into a time of turmoil, yet it was already suffering through a most difficult period brought on
by natural calamities. Under Japanese colonial rule, Korea was being pulled in Satan's direction; hence,
the March 1st revolution broke out in order to move things in a new direction.
The people who led that movement were people of faith, mainly Christians and adherents of the Cheondogyo faith. They presented a new direction that shifted from Japanese imperialism toward America with its
Christian culture. In this way, Christianity spread widely and penetrated deeply into the culture of the
Korean nation and people. This was possible because the Korean people, who chafed under the rule of
imperial Japan, were inclining more toward the Christian cultural sphere, which was influenced by the
United States. This is an amazing fact. Beginning from that historical uprising against Japan, Christianity
in Korea developed rapidly. (142-054, 1986/03/01)
7. Many Koreans sacrificed their lives calling for independence from Japan by carrying out the Mansei
Demonstrations that began on March 1, 1919. Why did such a tragedy take place at that point in time? It
was because I was meant to be conceived and born during a period of patriotic fervor.
I was born in the first lunar month of 1920, during the year after the March 1st Movement began. Why
was this significant? The Returning Lord must be born in a nation that God can claim, even if He can
claim it only conditionally. If the Returning Lord were to be born and come to a nation that had not
established such a condition, it would be as if he were floating in the air, without solid ground on which
to stand. That is why God led the March 1st Movement. So much blood was shed just for one person --
me -- to come to earth. That is why the Korean people suffered so much in 1919, both from famine due to
a poor harvest and from the loss of life through this heroic but tragic movement. It is based on such
indemnity conditions that God's providence has been advancing. (244-326, 1993/03/01)
8. Korean patriot and martyr Yu Gwan-sun died for her country at the age of 17 (by Western counting)
due to her involvement in the March 1st Movement. She was in the position of unfallen Eve; she was as
Eve in Adam's nation. Japan in the position of Satan decapitated her, and cut her body into 6 pieces. The
number 6 represents Satan. In devoting herself for the independence movement, Yu Gwan-sun
demonstrated her absolute loyalty to her nation, even at the sacrifice of her life. In 1919, when the
independence movement was spreading like wildfire, I was still in my mother's womb. The Returning
Lord is not supposed to be born into a nation under Satan's sovereignty; that is why this fight against
Japan took place shortly before the time of my birth. Ten months passed from the time of the March 1st
Movement to when I was born, in the first month of 1920. (229-033, 1992/04/09)

#### True Father's hometown
The Korean Peninsula is a providential land. Having the role of a bridge between the
civilizations of East and West, it is where preparations were made for the birth of the Lord at the
Second Advent. According to True Father, Jeongju, Father's birthplace where God's love came to
earth, was the place that God had predestined to be the starting point of a new future for
humankind. Also, the name "Sangsa-ri" the village of True Father's birth denotes a land whose
people yearn for and revere God. Sansa-ri will become a holy ground for the people of the world.
9. Located in northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula is geographically positioned to connect the civilization
of the Asian continent to Japan, which embraced the modern civilization of the West. To connect with a
continent, a civilization will often go through a peninsula rather than going directly to the continent. That
is why peninsulas always foster cultural exchange. In this sense, the Korean Peninsula has the role of a
bridge to bring Eastern and Western civilizations together and bear their fruit. Thus, it makes sense that
God will lead His providence for the world centering on the Korean Peninsula. For this reason, Korean
people must be equipped to embrace both civilizations and digest them. In the end, what enables a
civilization to bear fruit is religion. (078-312, 1975/06/10)
10. To which nation will the Messiah come? From the viewpoint of the Principle of Restoration, he
should not come to an independent nation. This is because originally Israel, and Judaism with its
influence on the nation of Israel, should have welcomed the Messiah and become his foundation. When
they were not able to do so, the foundation of the nation and of Judaism was lost, and as a result, the
Jewish people would later lose their nation and be scattered throughout the world. From the standpoint of
Jesus, the nation and the religion that should have supported him were gone; thus, Jesus had to start his
ministry from a position where he had no relationship with either the nation or the Temple.
Therefore, through the 2,000 years of history since Jesus' death, God worked to prepare a nation having
circumstances similar to those of the nation of Israel and then connected that nation to the providence
preparing for the day of the Lord at the Second Advent. Since the people of Israel began a history full of
misery and separation, in order to deal with this problem, God was required to find a nation enduring the
same suffering. From the perspective of history, the nation in that position was Korea. Indeed, the Korean
people have many striking similarities to the Jewish people in terms of where they are situated in their
region and in terms of their history. (067-244, 1973/07/01)
11. From the historical point of view, what nation has a people with a burning faith? Although the Korean
people were not familiar with the Christian term "God," and although they did not receive prophecies
from the biblical prophets, strangely enough throughout their 5,000 years of history the Korean people
always deeply revered heaven even without knowing why. That such a small country in the Eastern
Hemisphere survived era after era to this day, maintaining itself through 5,000 years of history is nothing
short of a miracle. If you look at the history of Korea, it underwent numerous trials, including being
invaded many times by neighboring countries.
Nevertheless, the Korean people were able to overcome such obstacles because of something deep within
their national spirit. With that spirit, they always looked forward to a hopeful tomorrow. Because they
possessed this spirit, because this national spirit could take hold and become the prevailing spirit on the
Korean Peninsula of the Far East, they were able to come out on top through all their battles. Isn't it fitting
that the Messiah come to a people who have endured, always advancing with this kind of spirit? On the
emotional level, no people in this region are more passionate than the Korean people.
Korea has also been called the eastern land of propriety. Buddhism, Confucianism and Christianity each
claim to be the religion of faith and righteousness, but now they have reached their limit. However, just as
the Korean people have upheld their spirit of hope for their nation, they are the kind of people who can be
fired up with the truth for the sake of the world. When this happens, their inherent passion for truth will
burst out from deep within their hearts. (007-166, 1959/08/30)
12. Korea has made many sacrifices during its 5,000-year history. Koreans have had a great influence on
China. Dwelling to the east of China, the Korean people took no pleasure in invading other nations. They
were a peace-loving people. That is why some Chinese people left their mainland nation and moved to the
Korean Peninsula. Even Confucius praised these people. He said that a holy people resided there and
expressed his desire to go and visit them. If you study Korean history, you will see that the Korean people
did not invade other countries. Although they were invaded numerous times, they never invaded another
country. However, when they were attacked unjustly, they were like fire; no one could defeat them. They
are a people literally burning with righteousness. If a Korean should happen to die while traveling in
regions such as Manchuria or Siberia, nothing would be found on his body except a tobacco pipe and a
flint. People from other countries carried swords or other kinds of weapons, but Koreans did not possess
anything like that. That is why if a Korean traveling in Russia or China knocked on the door at night,
most Russians and Chinese would welcome him in. Korea is indeed a country worthy of being the place
where I could appear. (179-030, 1988/06/15)
13. My hometown is Jeongju, in North Pyeongan Province, North Korea. I have many stories to share
about that place, and many anecdotes from my childhood. In the future, the people of the world will
regard my hometown in the same way Muslims regard Mecca and Christians regard Jerusalem. Therefore,
I urge you to visit my hometown in your lifetime. If you do not, when you go to the spirit world, people
there will accuse you, pointing their fingers at you and saying, "What in the world did you do while you
were on earth?" (034-067, 1970/08/29)
14. You should be able to say, "I attended the True Parents from the beginning to the end." Otherwise,
how can you become citizens of God's kingdom and build up the royal family in the heavenly kingdom?
That is why you must return to where the True Parents were born. Originally, the Garden of Eden should
be your home; Eden is where the True Parents were born. Due to the Fall, humankind lost the land of that
original home. However, now that the True Parents have become the owners of the Garden of Eden, the
place where the True Parents were born has become humanity's hometown. Hence, the place where the
True Parents were born is also your hometown. (166-255, 1987/06/07) 

#### Birth omens and name
Auspicious signs appeared around the time of True Fathers birth. In 1919, before the March 1st
Movement began, a golden bird flew to a tree in front of True Father's house and sang. After a
dream in which he saw a pair of dragons ascend to heaven, his great-grandfather Moon Jeongheul named True Father Yong Myung; yong meaning dragon and myung meaning light. However,
immediately after Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945, as True Father embarked upon the
course of his public ministry for the providence, heaven gave him a new name, so he changed his
name to Sun Myung, in accordance with the purpose of his providential mission.
15. When my mother was pregnant with me and her delivery date was nearing, she journeyed to her
hometown of Daesandong. Right beside my mother's hometown is a large mountain. From all directions,
nothing obstructs the view of this mountain, which is called Mt. Jeseok. It is a mystical mountain. While
my mother was waiting for the day of my delivery, she had a dream: The weather had become terribly
fierce. A heavy storm blew in and dark clouds covered her village. Then from out of the clouds came a
streak of light. From the top of Mt. Jeseok a golden dragon appeared. It encircled the waist of the
mountain, and then flew upward. My mother in her vision followed the dragon as far as the mountaintop,
then sat up there and enjoyed the sight of it as it flew about. Suddenly the mountaintop turned into an
ocean. In that ocean two golden dragons appeared, twisting and gliding and splashing their tails in the
water. Then with the words, "Farewell, my beloved world," they ascended into the sky.
My mother kept these things close to her heart. When I was eight, she told me the story and said, "No
matter how hard I think about it, I can only conclude that it is about the mission that you must undertake."
Once you come to know the Will, you can understand the promises of God that are revealed in such
symbolic dreams. My mother received many revelations. Whenever something special was to occur or a
difficulty might arise, she knew it in advance and made conditions of devotion to prepare for it. This is
how I know that by bringing heaven and earth together we can solve any problem. (401-218, 2003/01/07)
16. I can never forget something that my mother told me one day. She said that my great-grandfather, my
grandfather, and even one of my sisters-in-law had the same kind of dream about dragons. I cannot forget
the words that my mother uttered, "Whatever way I think about them, I know that all those dreams are
about you, the substance of the dragon." In one of her own visions, two golden dragons descended from
the top of Mt. Jeseok and stood in front of her house. Each held a magic pearl as it ascended into the sky.
She said that she actually saw them with her own eyes. Although the rain was pouring down that day,
when she looked at the mountain she could see all of that happening. (412-064, 2003/07/15)
17. The Chinese character sun in my name is the combination of two characters, symbols of a fish and a
sheep. They can also mean the ocean and the land, or the water and the earth. The character sun also
means bright and cheerful. When the morning sun shines radiantly after a night of rainfall, we say in
Korean, sunmyung-hada, which means "it is bright and clear."
The character myung is a combination of the sun and the moon. Thus, placing the two characters sun and
moon together signifies that clarity and brightness will pervade both heaven and earth. Heaven represents
man and earth represents woman, so when they become as one, all will be bright, clear and cheerful.
The character moon which is my family name, refers to truth. I am doing the work that my entire name
stands for. That is why throughout my life, whenever I look at my name I think to myself, "I must act and
live accordingly. I really must." (246-284, 1993/04/20)
