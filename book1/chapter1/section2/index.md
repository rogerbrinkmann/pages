## Chapter 1 The Significance of True Parents in the History of the Providence of Restoration

### Section 2 Lord at the Second Advent and Embodiment of the Holy Spirit

#### God's only begotten Son and Daughter
God's hope for Adam and Eve was that they would grow, reach perfection and form a true family.
This is what He originally intended at the time of the Creation. God created Adam as His only
begotten Son and Eve as His only begotten Daughter. With absolute love, He invested everything
in them, and in them, He placed all His hopes.  
However, they fell; so in their place God sent Jesus as His only begotten Son. According to the
order in which He had created Adam and Eve, God planned to restore Adam first and then to
restore Eve through Adam. Hence, first God sent Jesus as the Second Adam to take the place of
the First Adam, and then Jesus was supposed to find the original Second Eve and join with her,
becoming husband and wife. Had they succeeded in this, they would have become the True
Parents, the good first ancestors of humanity.

1. Jesus' greatest teaching is that God is his Father and that he is God's only begotten Son. The expression
"only begotten Son" indicates that he occupied the first love of God the Father; it means he stood in the
position to receive that love. It is because Jesus stood in the position to proclaim, "I am God's only
begotten Son," that God had to make Christianity a worldwide religion. The term "only begotten Son"
emphasizes God's love. The only begotten Son is the one who is connected to the fullness of God's first
love for an individual. (138-256, 1986/01/24)

2. In the Garden of Eden, Adam was God's only begotten Son and Eve was God's only begotten Daughter.
Singing together a song of spring -- "Brother, you are special to me!" and "Sister, you are so beautiful!" --
they should have grown to maturity and blossomed in the springtime of their lives. At that point, what
would God have done? When they were fully in bloom, emitting their unique fragrances, God would have
joined them together. That is, He would have held a beautiful wedding for them. Then Adam and Eve
would have realized God's supreme ideal of creation. But before this, God's only begotten Son and only
begotten Daughter first needed time to grow until they were fully mature. (159-195, 1968/05/10)

3. Jesus called himself God's only begotten Son. The only begotten Son needs the only begotten
Daughter. Jesus was to embark on the path to save the world, but he could not do it alone. He needed to
establish his family as the foundation. Jesus' purpose in claiming to be God's only begotten Son was to
unite the world and reign over it. Yet, before he could do so, he first had to form a family of his own.
However, he could not do that in his lifetime.  
Therefore, in order for the Messiah to save humankind on earth, he must form a model family for others
to emulate. Jesus needed to have a family before he could try to save Israel. Jesus was God's only
begotten Son. I am sure that if Jesus' wedding had taken place, God would have been its officiator. The
greatest purpose of God's providence of salvation is to build the family that He can love. For this purpose,
Jesus, God's only begotten Son, and a specially prepared woman, God's only begotten Daughter, were to
grow in God's love while attending Him as their Father and then receive His blessing at their marriage. In
this way, they were to establish the foundation to become the true ancestors of humankind. All of this was
lost and must be recovered. (159-192, 1968/05/10)

4. The title "God's only begotten Son" was finally fulfilled after Jesus came to earth. For the first time
since Adam and Eve failed and human history was lost to Satan, God's only Son, born of His lineage,
lived on earth. This was Jesus, the man who received God's love.  
Yet, even though Jesus emerged as God's only begotten Son, the only begotten Daughter did not appear.
The emergence of God's perfected only begotten Son after 4,000 years of the history of salvation was as if
God had created Adam again. In the Garden of Eden, God created Eve, modeling her after Adam. He
made her based on the same principle and blueprint He employed when creating Adam, so that she could
be his partner. When it states in the Bible that the woman was made from Adam's rib, it means that God
created her with the essence of Adam. That is why perfected Adam, God's only begotten Son, can recover
Eve, the one who has been lost to this day.  
In Jesus, God found the Adam who could establish His direct lineage of true love, but He was not yet able
to find Eve. In order to find Eve, fallen human history had to be rectified within a family, and a nation had
to be engrafted with that family. Preparation for this began with Jacob, from whom emerged the 12 tribes
of Israel. Based on the faith of the chosen people, their descendants expanded the scope of God's victory
in the world. Over the course of 2,000 years, they formed the nation of Israel and established Judaism,
both of which were prepared for the coming of Jesus. (347-171, 2001/07/04)

5. Jesus called fallen human beings to become God's sons and daughters, but what was most remarkable
was that he proclaimed himself God's only begotten Son. In a world where humanity had been paying
indemnity continually over thousands of years of history, this concept -- God's only begotten Son -- was a
sensation.  
What Jesus had to do next was to change the human lineage by reversing the positions of Cain and Abel
between himself and Judaism, and between himself and the nation of Israel. However, he was not able to
do that. Hence, although he recovered the title of God's only begotten Son, he was not able to meet God's
only begotten Daughter.  
That woman had been prepared, but it was not possible for Jesus to meet her without a tribal level
foundation. Beginning from Jesus' family, links connecting the individual to the family and the tribe had
to be established, so that the lineage of humankind eventually could be changed. (164-256, 1987/05/17)

6. Four thousand years after the first human ancestors, God's only begotten Son in all of heaven and earth
was born. This was blessed news. Before that, people had no way to connect with the bond of Godcentered true love. This has been the cause of bitter sorrow in people's hearts.  
Now, God's only begotten Son has appeared on earth! He has come as an intermediary for humankind, to
dissolve that bitter sorrow. Had he not appeared, it would have been a serious matter. There can be no
greater blessing than his coming. Therefore, all humankind and all of heaven and earth must be on his
side, even the Creator. Anyone who blocks his way will come to ruin, while anyone who welcomes him
will prosper. The appearance of the only begotten Son is a joyful day for all humanity. God sends him
first because history has been led by men. Once the only begotten Son arrives, the only begotten Daughter
then must come. (023-149, 1969/05/18)

7. God exists as the vertical Parent, centering on true love. The vertical is a single line. When it meets a
horizontal line, it creates a 90-degree angle where the two lines meet. Man is positioned on a line at a 90-
degree angle to the vertical; woman is likewise positioned at a 90-degree angle; and the point where man
and woman meet is at that same angle. There cannot be two different angles. The only begotten Son is the
first man in human history to receive God's love at a 90-degree angle. Someone must stand with him as
God's only begotten Daughter.  
The Messiah, who comes as the only begotten Son, must find the only begotten Daughter. Finding her is
not a casual matter. Since God created Eve from the body of Adam, when the Messiah comes into the
world he must find his Eve. He is the one who must recover Eve, because Eve was taken by Satan. Thus
at his return Jesus, as God's only begotten Son, must receive God's only begotten Daughter and establish a
way for man and woman to meet at a 90-degree angle. Otherwise, the fundamental problems in heaven
and on earth will never be solved. God has dual characteristics, and He can dwell only where the Son and
Daughter are one. (185-186, 1989/01/08)

8. Since the Fall of Adam and Eve, God has not just waited for the children whom He lost to return to
Him on their own. He has sought the path to free them from Satan's accusation. Can you fathom how
miserable God must have been? Can you even imagine His situation in the world where Satan played
king? He endured pain and suffering beyond description so that Jesus Christ could be born free from
Satan's accusation.  
Finally Jesus came. If the people of Israel had only united with Jesus, God's only begotten Son, they could
have reached beyond Rome and out to the world. Then Jesus could have become the True Parent. Instead,
because Judaism and the people of Israel were unable to fulfill their responsibility, Jesus departed with
the promise that he would return.
Tragically, although after 4,000 years God had found and established His only begotten Son, He could not
similarly establish His only begotten Daughter at that time. Nevertheless, since the only begotten Son
exists, the only begotten Daughter must also exist. The providence led by Jesus and the Holy Spirit was
for this purpose.  
We learned from the Divine Principle that whenever the central persons or central nations fail to fulfill
their responsibility, God finds another representative to complete the task. Thus, when God was unable to
send His only begotten Daughter to Israel on account of its not fulfilling its responsibility, God raised His
only begotten Daughter elsewhere. (True Mother, 2014/07/01)

9. Since God is the owner of love in the human world, God must have His family, which centers on His
love, living on earth. That family lives in God's original homeland, and it expands to a tribe, people,
nation and world of the original homeland. That is how the kingdom of heaven will finally unfold on
earth. All humanity longs for the original homeland, with its citizens in the original, perfected spiritual
state. God, too, longs for this. There, heaven and earth will meet in harmony. Everything in the universe
will rejoice in happiness. God will dance and the whole creation will dance together with Him.  
If such an original homeland, a place that all human beings would welcome, had emerged on earth, the
world we live in would not be filled with pain and grief. Had Adam and Eve been a son and daughter who
centered on God, namely, God's only begotten Son and Daughter, and had they become totally one with
each other and established a family in that original world, their descendants in that lineage all would have
been united in mind and body. (023-152, 1969/05/18)

10. Jesus came to earth in order to transform the world into the earthly kingdom of peace, on the
foundation of the nation of Israel. Even if he had attempted to accomplish that by exercising
overwhelming power and authority, he would have been unable to do so without first having established
his own family. The ideal world, the earthly kingdom of peace, begins with one true family and is
established through an assemblage of many true families. Individuals immersed in mind-body conflicts
cannot build an ideal family. Therefore, even if Jesus had the power to conquer the world, he could not
abandon the way of heaven that had called him to raise the family that God desired, even though this
brought him to the point of death.  
As God's only begotten Son whose mind and body were united, Jesus was to receive God's only begotten
Daughter, whose mind and body were also united, and together they were to establish that family.
Without that family, even if the world had been transformed it would be lost again in the end. The family
is bound together by bloodline. Once a people is bound together in the one lineage of God, that people
will constitute the one people of God. (023-152, 1969/05/18)

11. Jesus' purpose in coming again to earth is to find his Bride, a woman who is centered on God's love.
That woman must represent Christianity, attend the Lord as her Bridegroom on the world-level stage of
Christianity, and marry him. This establishes the realm of love of the Bridegroom and Bride. It is the
beginning of a realm of love that God can finally claim.  
Based on the realm of the only begotten Son, God can claim the realm of the only begotten Daughter. At
the same time, centering on this only begotten Son and only begotten Daughter, He can inaugurate the
realm of love of the Bridegroom and Bride. For the only begotten Son and the only begotten Daughter, it
does not matter how large their nation is, or that it has a long history or an amazing cultural background.
What matters is that their standard of conjugal love is such that they unite as husband and wife centering
on God.  
The first human beings lost this standard due to the Fall. Hence, without recovering it, everything in the
world is in vain. Therefore, the only begotten Son and the only begotten Daughter on God's side must
establish the realm of conjugal love as husband and wife. Once the realm of conjugal love is secured, the
realm of children's love will naturally be established. (138-257, 1986/01/24)

12. Jesus said that he was God's only begotten Son, and that God was his Father. That claim indicates that
as an individual he had received God's first love. Although God came to have His only begotten Son,
Jesus, He did not yet have His only begotten Daughter. Jesus was unable to find her.  
Thus, Jesus must return to meet God's only begotten Daughter, who can totally receive God's first love.
That is why the Lord at his Second Advent must celebrate the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. That is, he is
required to marry. This man who completely receives God's first love must marry a woman who
completely receives God's first love, and they must start a family together, thus restoring the positions of
unfallen Adam and Eve. (041-311, 1971/02/17)

13. The Messiah comes in the position of the original and direct Son of God. With God's absolute love, he
brings the seed of life. To find and raise such a Son is God's primary purpose for conducting the
providence of salvation through history.  
The Messiah comes to earth with nothing of earthly value. He has no nation. He has virtually nothing. He
does not have a partner. Because Eve, Cain and Abel were lost, he does not have a family. That is why,
when he comes, he has to recover them all.  
Christianity is the bride religion and is to receive the Messiah who comes as its Bridegroom. The core
truth of Christianity is amazing. Jesus called himself God's only begotten Son. Adam was intended to be
God's only begotten Son, and Eve was intended to be God's only begotten Daughter. However, due to the
Fall, they did not become the only begotten Son and Daughter. Satan claimed the only begotten Daughter.
God's entire creation was brought to ruin and must all be recovered. As God created Eve based on Adam,
God must re-create Eve by the seed that He sends through the new Son of God. (285-024, 1997/04/19)

14. Human beings start from a family. A family begins with a man and a woman becoming husband and
wife. Therefore, for the original family to begin, the only begotten Son must marry the only begotten
Daughter. The only begotten Son and Daughter were to have been the original Adam and Eve, free from
the Fall. Then they were to become True Parents and give birth to sons and daughters.  
As people who attend True Parents, if you want your sons and daughters to be perfected, you need to
provide them with an environment in which they learn how to live for the sake of others in the four
directions. These are represented by their grandfather, grandmother, father and mother. Children are to
live for the sake of their parents. Parents are to live for the sake of their children and also for the sake of
their own parents. Grandparents are to live for the sake of their grandchildren, and grandchildren are to
live for the sake of their grandparents. A husband is to live for the sake of his wife, and a wife is to live
for the sake of her husband.  
In this kind of environment the grandfather and grandmother, husband and wife, and all the siblings are
included. Following this principled model of the family, we should build a family in which we live for the
sake of each other. If we do so, this will indeed bring about the kingdom of heaven in our family. (252-
125, 1993/11/14) 

#### Freedom from original sin
Adam and Eve, the first ancestors of humanity, fell when they succumbed to Satan's temptation.
They ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus committing the original
sin. The original sin was an illicit sexual relationship. This sin defiled God's lineage. Instead of
passing down God's love through the ensuing generations, they multiplied descendants through
Satan's false love.  
In the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew records the genealogy of Jesus Christ. It preserves a record
of how in his lineage, among the descendants of the fallen Adam, good and evil were separated
and goodness advanced. It records how, during the 4,000-year history of the providence of
restoration through indemnity, the blood connection to Satan was severed in that lineage, in
order that Jesus could be born as God's only begotten Son.  
Thus, Jesus at birth had nothing to do with original sin. He came to this world to receive his
Bride and become the True Father, so that they could take the position of True Parents. They
were to give birth to children free from original sin, and also to give rebirth to fallen human
beings and remove their original sin. Instead, however, Jesus died on the cross due to the
disbelief of the people of Israel. Still, he left with the promise that he would come again and
complete the work he had left unfinished.  
Therefore, the Returning Lord, who comes as the Third Adam, inherits Jesus' foundation. This
allows him to start out from the position of the Messiah and from there to attain the position of
the True Parent. When he does so, he can fulfill the mission of completing God's ideal of creation.

15. Original sin is based on sexual relationships under the realm of Satan's dominion. Jesus was born
without original sin, and thus he is free from the condition of Satan's accusation. To make this possible,
God worked to reverse the positions of Cain and Abel. Jacob reversed positions with Esau; and Perez and
Zerah's positions were switched at the time of their birth. In this way, God laid the foundation for His
victory. As a result, Jesus could be born as a man free from original sin. (022-257, 1969/05/04)

16. Jesus is God's Son. He was born under God's dominion, free from original sin. Original sin is the
condition by which Satan accuses all human beings. Since Jesus is free of original sin, he can return to the
original position of Adam prior to the Fall. Therefore, Jesus alone could be the Second Adam, who came
to rectify Adam's failure and become the original ancestor of humankind. I am saying that he could stand
in Adam's stead. From that point on, humankind could enter a new era -- the New Testament Age. Since
Jesus was born free of original sin, he was totally free from Satan's accusation in terms of lineage. Not
only that, he subjugated Satan, the archangel. In this way, Jesus could stand tall in the position of the
original Adam. (159-206, 1968/05/10)

17. In the Bible we read the story of Jacob, who, to receive the blessing of his father, Isaac, cooperated
with his mother, Rebekah, to deceive his father as well as his older brother, Esau. We also read the story
of Tamar, who had sexual relations with her father-in-law, Judah, and gave birth to the twins Perez and
Zerah; it concludes with Perez and Zerah becoming the center of blessing for Judah's tribe. These stories
describe behavior that contradicts conventional morality. So why are they in the Bible?  
Besides, in the first chapter of Matthew, we read of four women of questionable morals: Tamar,
Bathsheba, Rahab and Ruth. The Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament is equivalent to Genesis in the
Old Testament. Why do these blemished, unholy women appear in its first chapter? There is no way to
answer these questions unless we know the Principle teaching on the human Fall. These questions have
been answered only since the time of my coming. (211-138, 1990/12/30)

18. Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, was in the same position as Eve. When Adam and Eve fell, they
were like a betrothed couple. Therefore, any woman chosen to restore Eve's fall through indemnity would
also have to be betrothed to someone. In such a position, Mary had to follow the tradition of Rebekah and
Tamar. She stood in the position to inherit the tradition, representing those women who had acted to
purify the lineage. To give birth to God's child, Mary upheld God's Will at the risk of her life and
willingly went the way of sacrificing herself. Like Tamar before her, she regarded the establishment of
Israel's kingship as her supreme hope. Disregarding her own life, she strove to inherit God's Will and
bequeath it to the Son of God. She was such a historic woman. (139-304, 1986/01/31)

19. Mary pursued God's Will with more passion than any other woman. She was a courageous woman
like Tamar, who, with utter devotion and loyalty to God, willingly took whatever risk was necessary in
order to bring God's precious lineage into the world. When the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and
foretold that she would soon conceive a child, Mary said, "How shall this be, since I have no husband?"
And when the angel said, "With God, nothing will be impossible," Mary answered, "Behold, I am the
handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." (from Luke 1:34-38)  
Mary could not take that position without risking her own life. In accordance with the five books of
Moses, at that time, an unmarried woman who became pregnant should be stoned to death. Nevertheless,
God had Mary give birth to Jesus, because she placed God's Will above her life and her honor. Thus, for
the first time in human history, the Son of God was born. He was Jesus, born from Mary's womb in
accordance with God's Will. (035-222, 1970/10/19)

20. Satan could not make any accusation against Jesus in Mary's womb because Mary did not seek to give
birth to Jesus. On the contrary, she simply obeyed the command of God and lived for His Will. Not only
that: Mary set up a victorious foundation from beginning to end, from conception to birth, so that Jesus
could be born from her womb free of accusation.  
Ever since the tragic history of Adam and Eve, the basis of all the struggles of humankind had their
beginning in the womb. Finally, with Mary, a child inside the womb was separated from that basis. Such
was the lineage into which Jesus was born. Therefore, at the root Jesus is different from any other
religious founder, any prophet or any world-famous religious leader. Jesus is the world-level
representative who emerged from the lineage that Satan could not accuse. Jesus was the first man to be
born in the lineage centered on God. Further, he came on the foundation of all the conditions necessary to
separate sin from human history. This makes him the first person who was born of the lineage centered on
God. Because Mary acted with the pure motivation to attend God's Will, Jesus was born on earth as the
true Son of God. (035-223, 1970/10/19)

21. Jesus' father was not Joseph. He was a man in the realm of the archangels on God's side; not that of
the fallen angel. He followed God's direction. Jesus could be recognized as the original Adam because
God had prepared a foundation, surpassing that of Satan's world, for him to be on God's side. It was on
that foundation that God could sow His seed of life and Jesus could inherit God's realm of heart. Jesus
was born in such a position, from a seed that had been separated from Satan's lineage. Such a person had
never before existed in history. That is why Jesus could be the Messiah and the Savior of humankind.
Because he was the first human being born from a God-centered bond of love, he can rightly be called
God's only begotten Son. (169-195, 1987/10/31)

22. Jesus came on the national level with the authority of the king of kings. He inherited the victorious
historical foundation of a lineage changed from Satan's to God's. Therefore, although Jesus was conceived
in Mary's womb, Satan could not claim, "He is my son." Mary stood on the national level when she
conceived Jesus. She conceived him based on the foundation of Israel's history, which passed down to her
the tradition of Tamar's heart. Mary paid the indemnity of heart and, by doing so, rectified the mistake of
Eve. She stood among those women of Israel whose course was to bear sons dedicated to the change of
lineage. She conceived Jesus based on the completion of the restoration of the elder son. For these
reasons, from the time of his conception, Satan could not claim Jesus as his son.  
From the moment of his conception in Mary's womb, Jesus stood on the foundation of a lineage that was
already purified through this process in history. Hence, Satan could not claim Jesus as his son, even
though Jesus was conceived with the authority of the elder son that Satan had always coveted. God could
not establish His right of primogeniture unless His Son, who could claim his own right as the elder son
even while inside his mother's womb, was born on earth. That Son was Jesus. He was the first person in
history since the Fall who represented God's heart. Among all people, he could inherit this most deeply.
Therefore, Jesus was able to declare, "I am God's only begotten Son." Because he was the one who
restored the authority of the elder son centered on love, he could be the Messiah. (139-309, 1986/01/31)

23. Jesus came to earth based on the foundation of a process to purify the lineage. The change of lineage
was attained in the time of the twins: first, by Jacob's efforts with Esau to restore the right of the elder son
and then by Perez and Zerah, who fought in the womb of their mother, Tamar, and reversed the positions
of the older and the younger.  
This is recorded in the Bible. The Bible is revelatory. It is a book of treasures that can never be left out of
the history of culture, religion or the world. Hidden within it are the sagas and secrets of human history,
and matters to be untangled. These must be resolved. That is why we must restore the lineage. Jesus, who
was born from Mary's womb, changed the fallen lineage of Satan's world. He came from the position
where his lineage already had been changed. Accordingly, his Bride, his partner, also had to go through
the process of changing her lineage. (140-149, 1986/02/09)

24. The True Parents about whom the Unification Church speaks are human beings, a man and a woman.
That man and woman must be centered on God. Since Adam and Eve became the false parents, True
Parents must come in their place and become the good parents. In other words, since it was due to their
failure to reach perfection that Adam and Eve became the false parents, True Parents must be able to
stand in their place, in the position of having perfected themselves centering on God.
Originally, God's ideal at the time of the Creation was for Adam and Eve to reach perfection and become
the True Parents. That position must be rectified and the original ideal must be attained. I am the one who
is pursuing that ideal.  
In the Unification Church, people call us True Father and True Mother. In external appearance there is no
difference between us and you; however, our root, our origin, is different from yours. The True Parents
emerged with God as the root, the first such human beings in history. We have come as the central people
of the Unification Principle and we introduce it with true love. (148-040, 1986/10/04)

25. My lineage cannot be accused by Satan. If it could, I would not be able to accomplish anything. I
conduct the marriage Blessing to transfer that lineage to you. It is what you inherit from us in our
positions as the Bride and Bridegroom, which were set up and transferred to us by Jesus who has been
working hard for nearly 2,000 years after his death and has now returned. The marriage Blessing is the
ceremony of the Unification Church that creates blessed families. Once you receive the marriage
Blessing, the gate to the kingdom of heaven is always open. Satan cannot accuse you once you are
blessed. (054-270, 1972/03/25)

26. Ever since the Fall, the bodies of all human beings have been dominated by sin, all kinds of sins. This
is because human beings are connected to Satan's lineage. How can we deny it? The way to resolve this is
to follow the course of indemnity. Now we, True Parents, have paid off everything. We paid indemnity on
all levels -- the individual, family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos. We indemnified them all, and
thereby connected them all to the true lineage of God.  
This means you are now in the position of small messiahs. As True Parents, we belong to the lineage of
God, not to Satan's lineage. Our root is different from yours. Your roots are on the side of Satan, while
our root, the root of the Parents, is with God. As True Parents, we inherited God's original love, which is
true love, and we are connecting it to you. Once you are engrafted with us, you belong to True Parents,
who belong to God. (146-302, 1986/07/20)

27. I, True Father, gained victory over Satan's world by going through eight vertical stages, from servant
of servants to servant, adopted child and so on, and eight horizontal stages, from individual to family,
tribe, people, nation, world, cosmos and God.  
When Adam committed the original sin, he entered Satan's realm. He can return to his original position
only when that sin is removed. However, he cannot clear original sin by himself. Only True Parents can
do it, with true love. That is what I did, clearing it on all eight stages.  
Adam fell at the age of 16. Before he reached that age, he was the original Adam. Before the Fall, he was
an original young man heading for perfection, who could have inherited everything from God. I came as
the Lord at the Second Advent to inherit everything that he could not.  
I fought Satan at every stage -- individual, family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos -- and expelled
Satan from each. I resolved the fundamental problem of sin. I am saying that I have uprooted original sin.
Beginning at the age of 16, I took the position of victorious Adam, having nothing to do with the world of
the fallen Adam. Ever since then I have labored to recover all humankind. (265-142, 1994/11/20)

28. I was born as a farmer's son in a Korean village, but my origin is different. Some people know things
intuitively from their birth, and others learn by studying. I knew the fundamental truths from birth, not by
studying. I learned them from heaven. I was born for heaven's will, and I knew them from birth. I even
came to know the heart of God. This is why, despite all kinds of opposition from the world, I could
survive until now. (542-285, 2006/10/23)

29. Once you come into total oneness with God, God links you to the preparations He has made in
advance for you. When you reach that level, the spirit world will teach you directly. I met someone who
testified that he had been attending me even before my birth, before ever meeting me personally. That
person was much older than I was and had been serving me even before I was born. This was possible
because God predestined my coming. When God sends a central person into the world, He works by
giving to people visions that resemble that person in both internal nature and external form. Thus, even
before my birth, He gave people visions of my appearance. (028-094, 1970/01/04)

30. My birth on earth was not as just the son of an ordinary family. From the age of ten, I learned
everything about the world. Hence, I was well known in my clan and throughout the village. I was born
on the basis of heavens preparation over thousands of years. On that foundation, I could understand the
world. Even before I was born, elderly people who were spiritually open experienced me guiding them.

#### Returning Lord and embodiment of the Holy Spirit
Due to his death on the cross, caused by disbelief among the people, Jesus was unable to
complete the path of the True Parent on earth. After his resurrection, therefore, Jesus had to find
a spiritual Bride; this was none other than the Holy Spirit. Then, with Jesus as the spiritual True
Father and the Holy Spirit as the spiritual True Mother, they could carry out the providence of
salvation in a limited way, by giving spiritual rebirth to fallen human beings.  
In order to complete the providence of salvation both spiritually and physically, Jesus needs to
come again. Therefore, Jesus at his Second Coming needs to be born on earth in the flesh as the
Lord at the Second Advent, the Third Adam. Then he needs to receive as his Bride, the woman
whom God prepared as the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Together they become the substantial
True Parents, who can give rebirth to humanity both spiritually and physically. The True Parents
remove original sin from humankind. They offer the grace of rebirth -- the change of lineage --
opening the way to complete salvation in spirit and flesh.

31. Adam failed to fulfill the Will, so God sent Jesus in his place. That is why the Bible identifies Jesus as
the Second Adam. Since the first human ancestors were lost, Jesus had to restore the true ancestor. Thus,
Jesus came as the True Father of humankind, and the Holy Spirit came as the True Mother of humankind.
Thus, they established the True Father and the True Mother, spiritually. God's purpose for the Second
Advent is to manifest True Parents on earth substantially.  
The Last Days are the time when God's True Son and True Daughter emerge to stand in front of
humankind. Human beings lost their true ancestors and became fallen descendants, disconnected in their
lineage from True Parents. Hence, the Last Days are the time for the True Parents to recover the
descendants who were lost, by reversing the course of the Fall. (007-116, 1959/07/26)

32. Jesus, the center of Christianity, is the Bridegroom. He receives his Bride at the Marriage Supper of
the Lamb. The Marriage Supper of the Lamb refers to the wedding of two human beings in the flesh: a
man and a woman in the positions of Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  
For Christians, God is the Father and Jesus is the Son. The Holy Spirit is the mother spirit. Thus, by
receiving the Holy Spirit we are reborn. We must be given rebirth by the Holy Spirit. Human beings are
born through their parents' unity in love. This is natural law. Jesus is the father; the Holy Spirit is the
mother. In other words, Jesus is the Bridegroom and the Holy Spirit is the Bride. When the Holy Spirit
comes into your heart, if your yearning heart unites with the Holy Spirit's yearning heart for Jesus, you
will be enraptured. The spirit of love from the spiritual True Parents -- Jesus and the Holy Spirit -- will
then infuse you with new life. This is what Christianity calls rebirth. (019-202, 1968/01/07)

33. True Father is the perfected Adam. Since Adam fell and could not become the True Parent of
humankind, we are the descendants of false parents. For this reason, the Messiah must come as the True
Parent. More precisely, he is the True Father. Christianity speaks about the Trinity. In fact, Jesus is the
True Father and the Holy Spirit is the True Mother. That is why human beings can be reborn through
them. Children cannot be born unless their parents first make love.  
Hence, it says in the Book of Revelation, "The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come.' And let him who hears
say, ‘Come.' And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price."
(Rev. 22:17) This speaks to the day when the Holy Spirit comes in the flesh at the time of the Second
Advent. That is the day when the Bride is made ready for the wedding. It is the day of the Marriage
Supper of the Lamb, when children welcome and attend the True Parents who had been lost. (007-158,
1959/08/30)

34. Jesus is the father, and the Holy Spirit is the mother spirit. We should be moved by the mother spirit.
Because of Eve, the mother, we were lost. Therefore, the perfect mother spirit must come to us and purify
our minds and bodies. Then we should experience becoming one with the perfected father spiritually.
Only by having such an experience can we be reborn. We read in the Bible, "Blasphemy against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but
whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
(Matt. 12:31-32) The Holy Spirit is the mother spirit. A person is born by coming out of his or her
mother's womb. But because something went wrong with our birth, we need a second birth. That is, since
we were born from false love, we need the mother spirit to give birth to us again with true love. (245-027,
1993/02/28)

35. In order for Jesus to have a family foundation, he should have received his Bride -- the woman who
came as the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Had he received that woman who embodied the Holy Spirit,
he could have worked freely on the horizontal level. However, Jesus was able to set this condition only
spiritually, because his three core disciples failed to meet the standard of becoming his sons. This was
Jesus' bitter sorrow.  
Since people on earth were not able to make an adequate indemnity condition, Jesus had to ascend to
heaven prematurely. Man represents heaven and woman represents earth. Jesus, the True Father of
humankind, has been in heaven. The Holy Spirit is the True Mother of humankind. Therefore, the Holy
Spirit must come to earth in the flesh. However, God's only begotten Daughter was not able to emerge at
the time of Jesus, and that Will could not be fulfilled. (023-176, 1969/05/18)

36. The kingdom of heaven is a place where men and women enter together with their families. However,
when Jesus came to earth he could not find his Bride, and he died without being able to have children.
Hence, to this day he remains in Paradise, where for 2,000 years he has been praying and working
through the Holy Spirit.  
In the beginning, a woman first committed sin. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, a feminine spirit, must come to
the world as an actual woman and cleanse that sin. This will happen when Jesus comes again to the world
as the Bridegroom and furnishes the new seed. Through reviving Jesus' mission, God's purpose is to build
a new God-centered world based on the lineage of the True Parents of the new heaven and earth. When
that world becomes manifest, we can say that God's Will has been fulfilled as planned. (021-199,
1968/11/20)

37. The Holy Spirit that Christianity speaks of actually refers to the mother spirit, the Second Eve. Since
Eve, the mother of all human beings, fell, God sent the Holy Spirit, the mother spirit, as the Second Eve.  
If we find a hole in a wall, we have to fill it in. If we lose something, we have to look for it where we lost
it. Likewise, since it is because of Eve that all human beings on earth entered the realm of death, we need
the Holy Spirit to come to earth and labor to give birth to us again. In the Bible, we read that women can
be saved through giving birth. (I Tim. 2:15) This does not refer to women living on earth today, but to
Eve.  
Had Eve not fallen but become the true ancestor of humankind, she would have given birth to good
children. Instead, she fell and gave birth to Satan's children. Therefore, the Holy Spirit embraces
humankind and labors to give them rebirth. Only when that labor is finished will Eve be saved and the
mission of the Holy Spirit come to an end. (009-138, 1960/05/01)

38. The spirit and the flesh were separated due to the Human Fall; they must be reunited. After his
resurrection, Jesus came to earth and laid the foundation for the Holy Spirit to come. Yet that was not
enough. Jesus left promising to return. To keep that promise he must come again. The purpose of Jesus'
coming again is to find the mother in the flesh, who was lost in the Garden of Eden. Then the Parents, in
both spirit and flesh, can finally emerge among human beings as the mediators between heaven and earth.
The full achievement of Jesus' hope will be possible in the world of the one ideal, a world in which the
spirit and the flesh are united. (005-072, 1958/12/21)

39. We live in a time when women can move the world for God's providence of restoration. This indicates
that the time has come when Eve can emerge to restore the world. This Eve is the embodiment of the
Holy Spirit and the representative of all women on earth. She must become a true wife and a true mother;
then she must become a true queen. Therefore, she will be equipped with the qualities to become such a
person. Her character will be such that she can take responsibility for all three of these roles, and more.
God has sought for such a woman, who can become a true mother, a true wife, a true queen, and more.
Once God calls her, this woman should be able to reject Satan's world and march bravely forward. (093-
040, 1977/05/01)

40. You must understand how arduous the course was to place Mother in her position in the providence of
restoration. Just to find one man, Adam, all kinds of bloody struggles and innumerable conflicts were
intertwined throughout history. Likewise, in order to find True Mother, you cannot imagine how great a
price had to be paid, how many sacrifices were necessary. In order to set and maintain the standard
necessary for True Mother to be found, people thousands of years ago received revelations, and prepared
people had to inherit those and bequeath them from generation to generation. That is how we have arrived
at this time. As if passing a candle flame from one candle to the next, countless people guarded that holy
light to make sure that it did not go out, giving their utmost devotion right up until the Last Days. You
cannot imagine what an enormous price has been paid, the uncountable sacrifices that have had to be
made. (264-056, 1994/10/09)

41. The term "Holy Spirit" refers to the spiritual mother. Jesus, in unity with the Holy Spirit, multiplied
spiritual children and laid the worldwide foundation that is Christianity. Yet, since the worldwide
foundation of Christianity was laid only on the spiritual level, this foundation is not sufficient for us to
fulfill God's Will spiritually and physically. Thus, we come to the conclusion that Jesus must return. It is
inevitable, because the physical world remains imperfect. Unless the spiritual foundation of Christianity is
connected to the foundation that Jesus at his Second Coming builds in the physical world, we cannot go
beyond our current history and begin a new history, that of God's world, in the spirit and the flesh. (073-
241, 1974/09/22)

42. Jesus tried to restore the failure in Adam's family on the national level. However, the people in Israel
did not believe Jesus and he was killed. Thus, Cain and Abel emerged on the national level, and this has
expanded to the world. Jesus was not able to reach beyond the national level, and he left the earth with
bitter sorrow in his heart. Therefore, he developed only God's spiritual nation and had no earthly nation.
The Holy Spirit, the mother spirit, has no form, yet can be likened to an anointing with oil, water, or the
wind, which comes to people and moves their hearts. By doing so, the Holy Spirit has been working to
create the Bride, who will come in the flesh. It is on that foundation that in my time I was able to establish
Mother on the world level. Through this, True Parents can achieve the liberation of the physical realm.
(407-180, 2003/05/15)

43. For True Mother to emerge, there had to be preparation for three generations -- her maternal
grandmother, her mother, Daemonim (Hong Soon-ae), and True Mother. Without it, she would not be
able to stand in the position of True Mother. Her grandmother brought her family to the Holy Lord
Church. Her mother brought them to the Inside the Womb Church, and then in the South they lived a
nomadic life searching for the Returning Lord. Mother was raised while leading such a life. (541-211,
2006/09/30)

44. True Father cannot marry just any woman. The Eve whom he can take as his Bride must be prepared
through three generations. True Mother went through such a course. She inherited the foundation of the
Holy Lord Church, where she received the blessing of Rev. Kim Seong-do, who was in the position of the
First Eve. Following that, she also gained the foundation of the Inside the Womb Church, where she
received the blessing of Rev. Heo Ho-bin, who was in the position of the Second Eve. It was Daemonim
who made this possible.  
In accordance with the law of restoration through indemnity, having gone through that course, Mother
was responsible to stand on that victorious foundation and attend the Returning Lord. The reason Jesus
could not marry was because the proper condition had not been established according to the law of
restoration through indemnity. (265-153, 1994/11/20)

45. The True Parents emerged on the foundation of unity between Cain and Abel. The time having arrived
when the True Parents could appear, the Holy Spirit in the position of the mother and Jesus in the position
of the father finally descended from heaven to earth and fulfilled the marriage Blessing substantially, as
the True Father and True Mother in the flesh. That is what happened in 1960, when True Parents formed
their family. They began engrafting people with the true lineage and multiplied blessed families
throughout the world. They subjugated even Satan by establishing the realm of liberation in the spirit
world, connected to the realm of liberation on earth. (333-015, 2000/09/24)

46. Now that the True Parents have emerged on earth, Jesus is united with True Father and the Holy Spirit
is united with True Mother.  
Jesus' mother, Mary, and John the Baptist's mother, Elizabeth, did not cooperate with each other; this was
a contributing cause of Jesus' death. At that time, the entire nation of Israel and all the leaders of Judaism
should have joined together to support Jesus, and in particular, they should have found Jesus' Bride. Then,
Jesus and his Bride could have given rebirth to humankind.  
What could not be done in Jesus' time on the national level must be indemnified, this time on the worldlevel stage. It is True Mother's work to reach the world level; then the work must be expanded
horizontally. That is why Mother is traveling and being proclaimed throughout the world. It is because
every human being must return to True Mother's womb and become one with True Father, like the joining
of ovum and sperm, and be reborn. (235-252, 1992/09/20)

47. In fallen families there are mothers and children, but the men in those families are in the position of
archangels. Therefore, men must unite with True Father, the one in the position of Adam. All the women
of the world must become second selves of True Mother and unite with True Father from that position.
By making those conditions, it is as if they have become True Father's original sons and daughters. This is
how they can be reborn and restored.  
You need to stand in the position of having been reborn as sons and daughters of True Father. By this, I
mean that you need to even enter Adam's bone marrow before Adam and Eve were married, and exist
there as if you are his seed. Then you, as that seed, must connect to Mother through their true love for
each other. The spark of that connection is like the electricity flowing from a disused power station when
its power is switched on again. That is why I say that you need to be reborn through true love. Mother is
the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. (243-224, 1993/01/10)

48. You are the sons and daughters of True Mother, the woman who represents the world. Especially you
women who follow Mother, you should become Mother's second selves. You should love her more than
you do your own husbands. Mother is the Holy Spirit. The Bible teaches that if you betray the Holy
Spirit, you cannot be forgiven. There is no way for you to be reborn. Even though she wants to forgive
you, you have no basis on which to be forgiven. Mother is the one who resurrects your life. She gives you
rebirth and then she blesses you. (233-087, 1992/07/30)
