## Chapter 1 The Significance of True Parents in the History of the Providence of Restoration

### Section 3 Completion of the Providence of Restoration

#### Lord, Savior and Messiah
Lord, Savior and Messiah
True Parents stand before fallen humanity as the embodiments of God's true love. True Parents
are the central persons who will accomplish the work of the Returning Lord and carry out God's
providence of salvation. They have the mission of the Savior and Messiah, to guide humanity
from false love and the evil lineage to true love, true life and true lineage, and to unite all
religions and all peoples.  
True Parents come to build the original world. In that world, people will establish a new culture
by inheriting the tradition of families that are centered on True Parents. Since they will be united
with God and engage with one another by giving and receiving perfect love, people will not need
a savior. Since they do not have original sin, every family -- parents, husband and wife, and
children -- will be able to live eternally with God. This is the ultimate destination toward which
God has been leading the providence through history. When it comes to pass, the purpose of
God's providence of restoration will be fulfilled and the ideal world that humankind desires will
be realized.

1. The goal of the providence of restoration is for God to settle on earth. Yet the foundation for the
fulfillment of that goal on earth was lost. Regardless, God takes responsibility to restore what was lost
and to fulfill it. He has led the providence of restoration in pursuit of this goal. The purpose for which
God sends the Messiah is to find the perfected husband and wife. This purpose is the same, whether in the
Old Testament Age or the New Testament Age. Just as the realm that Jesus established in the New
Testament Age had to fulfill the Old Testament Age, the realm that True Parents establish in the
Completed Testament Age must fulfill the New Testament Age. Thus, the realm of the Completed
Testament Age includes the fulfillment of the Old and the New Testament Ages.  
Jesus came to fulfill the Old Testament Age, and if he had, all could have been united. This unity should
have occurred in the New Testament Age with Jesus as the center. However, because it did not happen,
the fulfillment was prolonged to the era of the Second Coming. That is why the Completed Testament
Age that begins with the Second Coming must fulfill the Old and New Testament Ages. The Lord at the
Second Advent will fulfill everything. His coming inaugurates the fulfillment of the historical eras -- the
Old Testament, the New Testament and the Completed Testament Ages. (250-325, 1993/10/15)

2. When Adam and Eve fell and inherited the enemy's love, life and lineage, they destroyed everything
that God had intended for them. At the time of Jesus, had the spiritual world and the physical world,
represented by the leaders of Judaism and Israel, united with him on the national level, there would have
been no need for the Second Israel. Jesus should have united the spiritual world and the physical world, as
well as Israel and even the Roman Empire. However, because this did not happen, after a prolongation of
2,000 years, now I have to go one level higher. I have to break down all the barriers, including the walls
that were erected by the failure in Jesus' family, as well as by the failure in Adam's family. I have to break
down the barriers that have blocked good cooperation between the spiritual world and the physical world,
and the barriers in the spiritual world that have confined people to paradise (a realm lower than the
highest heaven) and even to hell.  
To enable this to happen, God is proclaiming, "Sun Myung Moon is the Savior! He is the Messiah! He is
the Lord at the Second Advent!" Once you meet the True Parents, you do not need a Savior, a Messiah, or
a Lord at the Second Advent. They are all included in the True Parents. (471-213, 2004/10/03)

3. True Parents are the Savior. They have come to save the world. Since the false parents gave birth to a
world of false love, True Parents need to save the world with true love. The Messiah also brings unity
among the religions. When the religions are united centering on true love, they will form one great family.
The world is advancing to establish this great family; only in this way, can there be true peace.  
All religions are advancing to bring about peace, which comes from unity. Furthermore, the First Israel,
which is the Jewish nation, and the Second Israel, which is Christianity, must pass beyond the First Adam
and the Second Adam and advance centering on the Third Adam, in order to rectify all of their failures on
the family level, the national level and the world level. Once the True Parents stand firmly on that
foundation, they will finally recover all that was lost in the earthly world, as well as what was lost in the
spirit world.  
The True Parents are the king and queen among those who can save the world. They are the king and
queen among messiahs. They are the king and queen of the Old Testament Age, the New Testament Age
and the Completed Testament Age and the representatives and the embodiments of the invisible God. The
True Parents were born for the sake of God, not for themselves. That is why even God exists for the True
Parents. God and True Parents are one in true love. (399-178, 2002/12/23)

4. At his coming to earth, the Messiah and Savior must liberate all humankind from hunger and from the
tribulations in their nations. Yet, among the things he must liberate them from, which is the most
important? The first is to liberate them from false love. The Savior is the liberator of love, the liberator of
life, and the liberator of the lineage.  
People are suffering because their lineage has changed from God's to Satan's. If all of humankind had the
same lineage, stemming from God, everyone would be siblings, loving one another centered on God.
However, their lineage was changed. Thus, the core mission of the one who comes as the Messiah and
Savior is to liberate all people by changing their lineage. (194-011, 1989/10/15)

5. Had we human beings not fallen, we would know God. Knowing Him in our hearts, we would
naturally know how to live, no matter what the world says. Our body would unite with our mind; they
would not struggle with each other. Our mind and body meet at the wrong angle as a result of the Fall. In
order to align them properly, the religious world teaches us to strike our body. That is why people do all
kinds of penance: fasting, serving others before ourselves, living a sacrificial life, even shedding their
own blood for heaven. Unless we put ourselves through such painful situations, we cannot return to our
original position. Not only must we align mind and body within ourselves as individuals, we must do so
on the family, national and world levels. The Messiah comes as the model to teach the world how to align
at every level, centered on true love. (178-190, 1988/06/04)

6. People will not believe that I am the Returning Lord, the Messiah and True Parent just because you or I
say it is so. My authority to stand as the Lord should be based on actual achievements. Until I overcame
Satan's world and established a foundation with certifiable evidence upon which I could stand, there was
no basis for people to come to their own realization that I am the Messiah and True Parent.  
I endured numerous ordeals and difficulties as I strove to establish a foundation on which I could stand
and be recognized as the Messiah and True Parent in both heaven and on earth. I had to lay such a
foundation so that people would acknowledge me as the Messiah and the True Parent throughout the
entire cosmos. Unless I could do that, I could not make that claim. That is why I have done so many
things in my lifetime. I did things that no individual could dream of doing. I did what even nations cannot
do. (396-265, 2002/11/10)

7. I could not just come to the decision "I am the Messiah" on my own. I could not carry out the Messiahs
mission based on my personal views. Rather, all my circumstances led me to the self-awareness that I had
been called to fulfill the responsibility of being the Messiah. There was no other way I could go. The
potential for the Fall began from the moment, when in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve came to have
self-awareness. It is the same with restoration.  
I could not meet the standard of the Messiah just by words. Nor could I meet it just because God blessed
me to be the one. Although God had blessed me, I still had to establish the necessary foundation by
substantiating His blessing. This meant that I had to reach the level where I could live with God and be in
the realm where God and I were relating as equals. When I had secured this in reality, I could receive the
inheritance and the title of "Messiah." I could inherit everything from God by reaching the level of equal
participation, equal position, and living together with Him. He had to recognize me by saying, "Certainly
you are the True Parent; certainly you are the Messiah."  
I had to become like a lighthouse that gives out light to ships in the night. As a lighthouse lights up the
darkness so that ships can find their way with certainty, the Messiah must be able to shine a bright light
into a world engulfed in darkness, a light that shines no matter how dark it is. (396-023, 2002/11/02)

8. All things belong to God. I am saying that God is the Owner of all things. Yet Satan thus far has been
acting as if he were the owner. In a relationship of love where there is a sense of equality and balanced
participation, the two parties cede control to each other. Blessings and the authority of inheritance are also
involved. Therefore, after the first human beings formed a love relationship with Satan, all things ended
up belonging to Satan's realm. Satan usurped God's throne and sat on it. He invaded even the environment
around God Himself, ruling over everything.  
There was no way God could liberate Himself from this situation. Nor could anyone else liberate Him,
even after the passing of thousands of biblical years. That is why God underwent so many hardships in
order to restore human beings to the standard that He had envisioned for the original family.  
With my birth, for the first time in human history everything in God's environment that Satan had defiled
could be cleaned up. I cleaned up that environment front and rear, and right and left, and by establishing
the measures and formulas to defend God from Satan's realm. Consequently, Satan had no choice but to
retreat. Anyone who objects to this will meet with difficulties. I am saying that True Parents have
succeeded in doing all of this. We have established a victorious realm on the individual level and on the
family level. (290-103, 1998/02/03)

9. I devoted my entire life to abolishing hell and the middle realms in the spirit world and to opening the
gates to the kingdom of heaven. I took it as my destiny to resolve this problem. Even if I do not talk about
this, I should be able to command people on the foundation that those in my surroundings recognize me
and attend me. Even without my saying that I was the True Parent, people received messages directly
from the spirit world that I was the True Parent, the Messiah and the Returning Lord, and they testified
about this.  
There can be plenty of messiahs, true parents and saviors on the individual level, but the individual level
alone is not sufficient. Heaven and earth should publicly recognize that I am the Messiah on the cosmic
level. The spirit world should testify, "He is the Messiah and our True Parent." True Parents should stand
on the victorious foundation of uniting the spirit world. (396-265, 2002/11/10)

10. After representing his nation, the Messiah comes as Abel to the world. Hence, once he has met the
national-level condition to indemnify the history in which Cain killed Abel, on that foundation he finally
can come to the world in the position of the True Parent.  
Had those of the Jewish faith and nation united to support Jesus and to establish the national foundation
by rectifying the history in which Cain murdered Abel, Jesus could have stood in the position of the True
Parent. In the history of restoration, after siblings become one, the Parents can emerge.  
On the national level, Judaism and the people of Israel should have become one to support Jesus, and the
leaders of Judaism and the chief priests should have united to support Jesus. Then they would have
restored the Cain-Abel relationship on the national level, and on that national foundation, the Messiah
could have emerged. That was Jesus. Had the people of Israel united with the Messiah, it would have
resolved on the national level the division between Cain and Abel that stemmed from Adam in the Garden
of Eden. Then the Messiah could have married and become the True Parent and, with the new, Godcentered family structure, emerged on the world level. (074-083, 1974/11/14)

11. After World War II, the United States brought the entire world under the realm of the elder son,
thereby establishing the authority of the firstborn son. However, in addition to that, the authority of the
Parents and the authority of God's kingship have to be established. For this, the United States will have to
attend True Parents. The United States established the right of the firstborn son, but does not yet know
True Parents.  
In order to restore God's kingship, the United States must attend the Lord at his Second Advent, the True
Parents. That is why One Nation under God is not enough. Now that the True Parents have come, we have
to build One World under God, One Universe under God and One Cosmos under God. When such a
world emerges, the kingdom of heaven on earth will be realized.  
In the free world, people do not have the concepts One World under God, One Universe under God and
One Cosmos under God. In the Last Days, when God's Will is to be realized, True Parents will come to
earth and establish one world, one universe and one cosmos under God by restoring the authority of God
as the Parent and God as the King.  
Jesus was unable to complete restoration on the national level in Israel and to realize the ideal of One
Nation under God. Therefore, I came to the United States, the summit of the world, in order to restore his
ideal of one nation under God. However, this ideal does not include the spirit world. It does not include
even the whole of the physical universe, not to mention the cosmos. It is not One Unified Spiritual World
and Physical World under God. That is why the Lord at the Second Advent must come to realize that
world. Had Jesus established One Nation under God and united even the Roman Empire, he could have
established one world. And had he united also the spirit world, he could have established One Cosmos
under God. Since this work was not completed, it remains to be fulfilled. No one has known about this;
only God and the Returning Lord know it. (311-116, 1999/08/29)

12. The Messiah comes as the Father. If he comes as the older brother, his siblings will fight him. Only
when he comes as the Parent can he bring an end to conflict. Thus, the title "True Parents" is amazing,
because when people have their True Father and True Mother, there can be true love among them. From
True Parents, centering on true love, true children can be born. Then a true family can emerge, and when
it expands horizontally, it can become a true tribe, people, nation, world and the true cosmos, in which
God can dwell. There is no disputing this logic.  
True Parents never existed in the past, nor will there ever be another set of True Parents. What joyful
news it is that the one and only True Parents to ever exist in history have emerged at this time! There can
be no greater news than this, ever! It is especially great when you enter a parent-child relationship with
True Parents and bond with their lineage; this enables you to inherit their authority without any sense of
shame. They will guide you beyond yourselves to the infinite world.  
You have no idea how remarkable it is that you know the name "True Parents." God created human
beings with this as His vision for them. True Parents' love makes the connection from true families to the
true world, the true kingdom of heaven on earth and the true kingdom of heaven in heaven. (266-250,
1995/01/01)

13. Based on the foundation of True Parents' victory, we are going beyond the Fall and entering the age
when we can proclaim the era of liberation and complete freedom in the new kingdom of heaven on earth
and in heaven. This is the proclamation that the time has come when we can enter the realm that has
nothing to do with the Fall.  
That is why the spiritual world and the physical world will have to unite. Unless you know the spirit
world, you will fall away. God, together with all the world-level religious founders, saints and sages, and
great people in the spirit world have resolved to work for the unity of these two worlds. Those dwelling in
paradise and even in hell have resolved to support this and they have declared this Liberation.  
I therefore am working to bring this same understanding and determination to people on earth. With the
coming of earth's true owner, the one who is the Savior, Messiah and Returning Lord, everything is
completed. Centering on the name of the True Parents, everyone can cross over into the new world of
liberation and live together with God, united in love. We have entered the era in which God can descend
from His throne and live with His children on earth, where He will personally involve Himself with their
lives.

#### Completion of the providence
God must continue His providence of restoration through history until He restores through
indemnity fallen Adam and Eve and installs the True Father and True Mother of all humankind --
the True Parents. The True Parents come as the sole, central model of God's ideal. They extend
their hands to save fallen people and show them the direction in which to go. They come at the
time when the history of God's providence bears fruit, when history can be made straight and
begun anew.

Looking at all the efforts of the True Parents, we see that they have rectified historical failures,
are uniting a divided world into one and based on this, are building the kingdom of heaven. True
Parents are the supreme and ultimate hope of humankind who complete the providence of
restoration. Thus, when they emerge and are welcomed by the world, the hope of history can be
fulfilled. The era when True Parents emerge in the world is the starting point for concluding
fallen history. (574-187, 2007/09/04)

14. True Parents are God's hope. They were God's hope at the beginning of the Creation and during the
eons of time during which He created everything. They were the ultimate goal of God's efforts throughout
history, even as He led the providence of restoration through indemnity. Unless True Parents appear in
this world, history cannot be set aright. God is the center of every perfected entity based on the ideal of
love. This is true for the individual, the family, the tribe, the people, the nation and the world.  
By centering on the perfected Adam, God wanted to establish the foundation of His object partners and
expand it to every level on earth. However, because of Satan, everything was frustrated. Therefore, when
the True Parents come, they must build their foundation on every level, from the individual to the family,
tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos. Then, once there is unity with True Parents on every level, all
human beings can be one with God in the kingdom of heaven. This is the purpose of the providential
history of salvation. (268-163, 1995/03/31)

15. Had there been no Fall, we would not have needed such terms as True Parents, the providence of
salvation, the providence of restoration, the providence of re-creation, the providence of resurrection, and
so on. Yet, due to the Fall, the providence of salvation became necessary and humankind came to need a
Savior.  
The Savior is the central person who represents God to human beings and reconciles human beings to
God. He comes to correct all the mistakes of history. What he must do is eliminate Satan. God cannot do
it Himself. Satan is the archangel who was supposed to be under Adam's dominion, but he subjugated
Adam instead. Therefore, it is up to Adam to recover his original position, and it is for this purpose that
the Savior must come. By presenting the Principle and attending God, the Savior must make Satan
surrender voluntarily and return to his original position. That is the only way to achieve a foundation for
peace that accords with God's ideal of creation. (214-260, 1991/02/03)

16. The providence of restoration is the providence of re-creation. When God re-creates, He needs to do it
through the original Principle of Creation. The center of the original Principle of Creation is one perfected
man and one perfected woman, who become husband and wife and follow the path of love. Without
building that bridge of love, no one can go to God. This is the way based on the ideal of creation.  
To fulfill this, God has sought to recover the one man, Adam. Yet until now, He could not. From the day
of the Fall to this day, God has worked through religion to seek for Adam according to the principles of
re-creation. That is why the world-level religions need to uphold the teaching that their lord, who
possesses the true way, will come to earth again and guide all of humankind to the world of peace, the
ideal world. This is not accomplished by a group of people; the standard is one central person, perfected
Adam. (195-130, 1989/11/07)

17. Adam and Eve were to have been perfected by uniting with their Heavenly Parent. Had they united
with their Heavenly Parent, all their descendants likewise could have stood in their parents' realm of
victory. This should have unfolded through eight levels: the individual, family, tribe, people, nation,
world, cosmos and God. When Adam and Eve fell, it was only the two of them, so the Fall occurred on
the individual level. Now, however, the realm of the Fall has expanded throughout heaven and earth. Just
two individuals, Adam and Eve, fell, but the result has spread not only to the physical world but also to
the spiritual world, from earth to heaven. Only by finally achieving that realm of victory on every level
will the liberation of humankind be possible.  
Multitudes of religious believers have been making indemnity conditions in their efforts to escape the
realm of the Fall. However, since they themselves are descendants of the Fall, it is impossible for them to
escape on their own. Adam and Eve, the first human ancestors, caused this situation when they fell.
Therefore, it is necessary that good first ancestors come and pioneer a path to escape the situation. Unless
these new key figures succeed in overcoming the Fall, no one will be able to escape from it.  
It is the Returning Lord and his Bride, the True Parents, who can accomplish this. True Parents must also
bring perfection on all levels, from the individual to the family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos.
And finally, they must liberate God. (251-019, 1993/10/15)

18. Human beings originally were created as God's children, but because they inherited Satan's lineage,
they came under the rule of Satan. That is why to this day humankind has been treated as the enemy's
children. Accordingly, True Parents must recover these children for God and, in the process, become the
ancestors of humankind. They have to clean up everything that became defiled throughout human history
and put Satan in a place where he cannot make accusations. They must pave paths that Satan cannot
accuse, whether traveling from the physical world up to the spiritual world or from the spiritual world
down to earth. True Parents have to travel back and forth and overcome all the conditions that Satan can
accuse. Satan has been able to make accusations due to the mistake made by the ancestors of humankind.
Therefore, True Parents, coming as the true ancestors of humankind, must completely pave the way from
the past, to the present, and to the future. (019-205, 1968/01/07)

19. From the beginning of human history to this day, God and Satan have been at war with each other.
God cannot stop it, nor can Satan. That war began due to the Fall of Adam and Eve. How, then, can this
situation be resolved? God intends to re-create them. The course of restoration is the course of re-creation.
Unless they are re-created, there can be no solution. That was His purpose for inaugurating religion: to recreate Adam and Eve. Among numerous religions throughout the world, Judaism, Christianity and the
Unification Church are at the center. They comprise three stages, culminating at the time of the Second
Coming in the Last Days when True Parents will emerge.  
True Parents know all the secrets of God, Satan and humankind. Satan's world is full of chaos. Above and
below, right and left, and front and rear, nothing is in its proper order. At the Second Advent, True
Parents will come to earth and begin to clean this up. Starting from themselves as individuals, they will
clear the way to recover the family, tribe, people, nation, world and even the spirit world. Then God's
ideal of creation, which humankind has long awaited, will appear in the mainstream of history. Hence, the
challenge faced by the Unification Church is how to establish ourselves as the mainstream. We must build
the highway, so that everyone can travel along it and arrive at the ideal world, the kingdom of heaven. In
that ideal world, nothing can hinder anyone on the path; even Satan cannot be there. It is simply a clean
and pure world. It is a world where all people can fulfill their purpose of life. It is a world where all are
free, both in the spiritual world and in the physical world. That world is our original homeland.  
Due to the Fall, people have been in misery. Until the True Parents appeared on earth, no one has been
able to solve this problem. Only through their coming can everything be set straight again. (315-139,
2000/01/30)

20. The path we have taken as True Parents has not been level and smooth. We have had to make the way
smooth across the gorges and canyons. During this time, God has been with us every step of the way.
This is why we can say that God is our Father and Mother.  
Jesus' disciples and Christian believers are supposed to take responsibility for the bitter sorrow that our
Heavenly Parent has been carrying for tens of thousands of years, as well as for the pain of Jesus, who
should have become the True Parent by finding his Bride on earth. Yet none of these believers are
determined to liberate our Heavenly Parent, or even Jesus, who was to have been the Parent on earth.
Most of them just want to receive blessings by believing in Jesus. When they go to the next world, they
will find themselves in trouble.  
All the while, God has shed tears like a waterfall. Knowing this, we, the True Parents, undertook the work
of liberating God as our mission. (357-055, 2001/10/26)

21. The Returning Lord establishes the True Parents of humankind, and they recover the realm of true
love. Then they go on to establish the position of the True Parents of Heaven and Earth. This is how they
are to complete the providence to restore humankind.  
The True Parents of Heaven and Earth must begin with a family in which they, as God's filial son and
daughter, attend God, honor Him and glorify Him, even better than the family of Adam and Eve would
have done had they reached perfection.  
The True Father, the Messiah, who is centered on true love, is the head of the family, which is the ideal
core of humankind. He is to begin history anew by connecting human beings to true life and true lineage
as they form blessed families, thus establishing the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven. (315-213,
2000/02/02)

22. The event at which, for the first time in human history, God's chosen Bridegroom and Bride joined
together is that glorious and honored event that Christians speak of as the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
This was the event at which the Bridegroom and Bride, enraptured with eternal love, praised their eternal
life with God and its value forever. On that occasion they joined together representing myriads of people;
this was the coming together of God and original human beings.  
Yet, reaching the position of a bride and groom was not their ultimate goal as the original human beings.
It is just one position on their course to perfection. Parents are the beginning of life. The life of the
original human beings began in the presence of the Heavenly Parent, and all human beings must find a
way to return to their Parent, God.  
Those who start out as parents, the root of new life, must start from the same position in which God stood
when He gave life to the first human beings. From that position, they should grow in the realm of God's
protection and then emerge as the Bridegroom and Bride. After that, by becoming parents they can return
to the Heavenly Parent.  
That is why I am saying that the positions of the Bridegroom and Bride are not the ultimate ideal.
Likewise, your final destination as human beings is the place where you attend God as your Parent and
become His true sons and daughters. Certainly that should be the summit of your hope, the place you all
should desire to reach.  
Based on this view, the Unification Church presents the ideal of True Parents. By going through the
process of becoming bridegrooms and brides, you also can arrive at the position of original sons and
daughters. God created human beings, but they fell. So you should be restored and reach perfection, and
by attending God as the True Parent you should attain oneness with Him in eternal value, in eternal life
and in eternal love. All of you need to start anew. This is the reason it is necessary for True Parents to
come to earth and guide humankind toward this goal following the path of restoration. God's purpose for
leading the providence of salvation for humankind thus far has been to arrive at this destination. (068-133,
1973/07/29)

23. There must be a true man and a true woman who attend God and unite with each other. They must
establish a conjugal relationship that cannot be broken, no matter what. And then they must give birth to
true sons and daughters. That man and woman are the True Parents. They are centered on God, are a true
husband and wife to each other, and give birth to true sons and daughters, thus establishing the fourposition foundation.  
True Parents are God's true Son and true Daughter. They are to be the center of humanity and the
universe. A nation that centers on them will become a central nation. On the other hand, a nation that
lacks that center will come to ruin, and a world that lacks that center will drift into oblivion. For this
reason, the culture that is centered on the True Parents will advance throughout the world. The culture
that starts from that center will never perish.  
Therefore, all families should make True Parents their center and attend God as True Parents do. All the
people of the world should live by the example of True Parents, by their value system, and in line with
their views on national and world affairs. The values they present will become widely held throughout the
nation and the world, and eventually all humankind will share these values and adopt them as their own.  
Humankind has proceeded in hope for the time of the Last Days and is now heading for that one gate.
True Parents' hope is to establish the God-centered true family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos. If
we all do this together, we can restore even God's love. (019-205, 1968/01/07)
