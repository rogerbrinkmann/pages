<h3 id="the-perfected-adam-and-eve">The perfected Adam and Eve</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>God created human beings to experience joy for eternity. Adam and Eve, the first ancestors of
humankind, were created to be the object partners of God's absolute true love. Humanity had to
originate from one ancestral couple. God created true love to flow in one stream; hence, He
cannot begin another stream of true love from someone other than one man and one woman. If
Adam and Eve had become perfect through God's absolute love and multiplied good descendants,
they could have realized an ideal family. Everyone in that family would have attended God the
Creator as their vertical, incorporeal true parent and perfected Adam and Eve as their
horizontal, substantial true parents on earth.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve's true family would have expanded into Adam and Eve's clan. Their clan would
have prospered, expanded into a society and nation, and ultimately built a world that fulfilled
God's three great blessings to "be fruitful, and multiply, and have dominion over all things." That
world would have been nothing less than the ideal kingdom of heaven that God intended to build
on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From seeing Adam and Eve who were created in His image, we can understand that God exists with the
dual characteristics of masculinity and femininity. It is because God has both of these characteristics that
God created Adam and Eve. Therefore, Adam and Eve needed to become one as subject partner and
object partner, as a perfect man and a perfect woman. Had they done so, they would have reached a
position equal to that of God. Then they would have given birth to sons and daughters and given them the
same love that God gave them when creating them.<br />
Human beings were God's greatest masterpieces among all created beings. He created them so that they
could also stand in the position of creating such masterpieces, human beings, as their children. God
therefore expected Adam and Eve to become completely one as husband and wife. Then, when looking at
the children born from their perfect union, Adam and Eve would have inherited the tremendous joy that
God experienced when He created them.<br />
God imbued Adam and Eve with the love that would have enabled them to give birth to children and love
them with that very love. In other words, Adam and Eve, being God's beloved children, totally received
every single thing that God, the Absolute Being, had within Him. (053-166, 1972/02/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original Adam and Eve were God's body. What I am saying is that these originally good ancestors
of humanity were to be a substantial manifestation of God. God wanted to enter their minds and become
one with them in physical form. In that state, even as God wanted to give them more and more, they --
God and human beings -- wou ld revolve around each other. Spinning like a rotor, they would become
completely one.<br />
Had such seeds of love been sown, their descendants, humankind, would have borne the fruit. Then, no
matter how far you dissected that seed, its core substance would never change. However, because of the
Fall, that seed needs to be dismantled and repaired; it must be fundamentally repaired, but this is
impossible unless they bring God back into their lives and attend Him.<br />
God created heaven and earth in order to share His life and love. This is why God, the incorporeal One,
brings forth a man and a woman as the eternal embodiments of His love. They are the True Parents, the
good human ancestors, whom He now introduces to humanity as the central substance of His love. (038-
173, 1971/01/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original Adam and Eve were to have been the True Parents. As Father and Mother, they would
have been the center of the family and regarded as the king and queen of the family. Their sons and
daughters would have been the heirs who could become future kings and queens. If the original ancestors,
Adam and Eve, had not fallen, God would have been the Grandparent who bequeathed His kingship to
their family. That is why the True Father and True Mother are the king and queen of their family and
represent all families in all nations. They are the original king and queen of the family, and you as their
sons and daughters are in the position of princes and princesses who will inherit their kingship in the
future as members of the royal family. (221-255, 1991/10/25)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the Fall of the human ancestors, God lost the true ancestors of humankind as He had envisioned
them according to the ideal of creation. Human beings, no matter how great or how wealthy, even if they
have the power to move the entire world, are still from the lineage of the fallen ancestors. This is a most
lamentable truth. People who are descended from the fallen ancestors are bound to plummet down to
Satan's hell. People throughout history have been searching for the original Lord, the original Parents who
are the true ancestors who can embrace fallen humanity as their true children. For this, God strove to
recover the positions of Adam and Eve prior to the Fall, following the path of restoration continually for
4,000 years, (154-261, 1964/10/03)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam and Eve, had they not fallen, would have become the true ancestors of humankind. They would
have become the True Father and True Mother, the True Parents of humankind, in the flesh. However,
Adam and Eve fell, and humankind became Satan's children. Suppose Adam and Eve had not fallen, but
instead had become a man and woman imbued with God's heart. They would have joined in holy
matrimony as God rejoiced over them, and become the True Parents of humankind. Then the created
world would have united with them in harmony, and joyfully provided their family with everything they
needed.<br />
Had Adam and Eve become a true son and daughter before God, had they become a true husband and
wife as the model for all human beings, and had they become the True Parents of humankind who could
attend God as their eternal Parent, they would have been able to sing with joy and happiness throughout
their lives. No one would ever have been able to lead them away, because they would have belonged
solely to the one Lord. Their heart and their love would have belonged to the one Lord. Their one Lord
would have been God. (009-137, 1960/05/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fall disrupted Adam's family. Therefore, the goal of restoration, to return to the original state
before the Fall, is to restore Adam's family. God first strives to recover one individual who will be His
partner; then he strives to recover one central family. Only after that can He strive to recover a church, a
people, a nation and then the world.<br />
Throughout history, God has been seeking a family that could become His ideal object partner. Such is
the True Family. The True Family is fundamentally different in substance from ordinary families. Unless
that God-centered family can be recovered and aligned with God's ideal, there is no way to recover the
ideal for the nation or the world. This is the reason that God must first establish the original True Family.
Similarly, salvation cannot be attained by individuals; rather, the basic unit of salvation is a true family.<br />
Had it not been for the Fall, Adam and Eve would have become the ideal husband and wife and, one-step
further, the True Parents. They would have become the True Parents to their posterity and all humankind.
Had humanity prospered with Adam and Eve as the True Parents, they would have built one great family
and established the world of peace in the Adamic cultural sphere. (294-067, 1998/06/11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history of God's providence of restoration is a sorrowful history. The fact that God lost Adam and
Eve is something to grieve over. The problem is that this loss did not end with those two individuals
alone. Losing them meant losing their clan, and this lost clan has since expanded into peoples, nations and
the world. By losing Adam and Eve, God lost them all. Thus, the loss of Adam and Eve meant that God's
kingdom and His sovereignty were lost. It meant the loss of God's family, God's clan and the people for
His kingdom. It meant the loss of the ideal of man and woman, the loss of God's only son and daughter.
That is why the history of salvation, namely the history of the providence of restoration, is to recover one
man and one woman, Adam and Eve. If Adam and Eve had not fallen but had prospered, today every
single human being among the many billions of people on our planet would be registered in the heavenly
kingdom. Everyone would naturally enter the heavenly kingdom as one family. (143-025, 1986/03/15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the fall of the first human ancestors, people could neither have true ancestors nor be true
descendants. Even God could not stand in the position of True God. Nothing was centered on God, so
there was no basis to build a true family, a true society or a true nation. For this reason, we must seek the
true root, and when we find it we will also find the nation in which everyone can live together as one true
family. That is why, through the providence of salvation, God has sought to build the one world, the
world of hope, true peace, love and oneness. To realize this purpose, God sends the Savior. The True
Parents must come to earth and teach humanity to make God their central focus as individuals, and to put
God at the center of the family, the nation and the world; by doing so, they are trying to return all
humankind to the original world. Such is the course of the providence. (267-297, 1995/02/05)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God's hope is not for the Lord to return on the clouds in the sky and build a spiritual kingdom like a
fantasy world. The reason he returns is to plant his feet on the ground and find the one Bride who can
receive God's total love. He does this work to recover all that was lost because 6,000 years ago the first
human ancestors became the false ancestors.<br />
Therefore, in the course of history, a perfect woman must emerge who is absolutely connected to God's
love. She must join with the perfect man who lives in oneness with God's love. She is able to stand as the
Bride of the Returning Lord, who comes as the Bridegroom. That time is at hand.<br />
When they unite in this position, they are at the level of Adam and Eve before the Fall, when they were
loved by God in the Garden of Eden. They have reached the point to receive from God the three great
blessings. With them emerges the foundational point on earth that Satan cannot invade. Had Adam and
Eve stood in this victorious position as the ancestors of humankind, the archangel Lucifer would not have
become Satan; rather, he would have attended them as a faithful servant. This is the Principle of Creation.
Because they lost that position, since that time, human beings been orphans. Therefore, the True Parents
of humankind, who can recover this position, must appear on earth. (022-084, 1969/01/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original Adam was one individual, yet he was meant to be the center of the family, the tribe, the
nation and the world. The culture would have been Adam's culture. From that culture, a language would
have begun. Thus, everything would have developed and prospered. Accordingly, all the events that
connect to True Parents can become sources for creating a new culture. From this new culture, a true
history of humankind can finally unfold. True families, societies, peoples, nations and a true world can
emerge.<br />
The teachings that True Parents have established as the tradition will be central in every age. Thus far,
human beings have based their hope for the world in a vision of the future, but no longer. Rather than
looking forward to something yet to be realized, we will advance centering on the teachings that True
Parents are practicing here and now. It is based upon their teachings that history will advance. The
heavenly nation to be erected based on those teachings will establish the center of the past, the present
and the future. Once this nation is inaugurated, its culture will not be short-lived. It will extend to the
world, and remain alive and well, becoming the source for future cultural development. There will be
total oneness. It will be the same, whether at the beginning or the end. (050-251, 1971/11/07)</p>

<h3 id="the-true-olive-trees">The true olive trees</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We read in the Bible, in the book of Genesis, about the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil that grew in the Garden of Eden. These two trees symbolize the perfect father
and mother. Originally, the human ancestors, Adam and Eve, perfect and having nothing to do
with the Fall, were to have been the roots of humankind. Having grown from those roots, all
people were destined to live in the kingdom of heaven on earth. After death, they would have
passed on to the kingdom of heaven in heaven and lived there eternally.</p>
<p>God's purpose of creation is for humanity to form a single God-centered family, in which all
would be kin. Fallen human beings are wild olive trees, stemming from wild roots. They need to
receive a graft from the true olive trees, True Parents, and be reborn as true human beings. By so
doing, humanity can realize the world according to God's ideal of creation, the eternal ideal
kingdom of heaven that should have sprouted from the Garden of Eden. The hope of humanity is
to receive the True Parents, adopt the good traditions of their God-centered family, hand them
down generation after generation, and thus build a united world of one language, one culture and
one sovereignty of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>True Parents are totally united with the love and lineage of the absolute God. Hence, we can call True
Parents' family, which they established after their Holy Wedding, the true olive trees, while people in the
fallen world are false olive trees. Then, if we make a cut in a false olive tree and graft a cutting from a
true olive tree onto it, it will eventually belong to the family of the true olive trees. This will connect
people to God's true love, true life, true lineage and true conscience, and they can reach perfection. When
they do, the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven will unfold.<br />
God could not have His third generation, His grandsons and granddaughters. Satan has them and even has
tribes of his own; they have multiplied to this day and built numerous countries. God, on the other hand,
has never had even one perfect man or one perfect woman. The Messiah is the one who comes as the
perfect man. He must find his Bride and establish the position of the True Parents through their marriage
and by having children. On this basis, he can restore the original family of humankind. (344-198,
2001/03/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had Adam and Eve become the True Parents of humankind, we would not have needed the Savior or
religion. God would have found joy in the world of goodness that had no need for religion. God wanted to
build such a world on earth, but His desire was not fulfilled. The Fall means that Adam and Eve failed to
unite with God. As a consequence, they failed to become True Parents; they became false parents instead.
Therefore, you must move from the false parents' lineage and return to God through the True Parents'
lineage. You are all descendants of those false olive trees. You should have been true olive trees, but you
became false olive trees who need to be reborn by receiving a graft from the true olive trees. (023-162,
1969/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents come as God's true olive trees. They are the ones who will give you rebirth. We cannot
be born without parents; it is the law of heaven. True Parents come to earth having the root of God's true
love, true life and true lineage. Their mission is to cut down to their stumps the trees of fallen people,
which were born from the root of false love, and graft the cuttings of true love onto them. We human
beings must find the root of God's true love that comes from the true olive trees. Only in True Parents is it
possible to find that root. (494-013, 2005/04/27)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The True Parents come with true love and true lineage. The false parents entangled human beings in
false love and false lineage. We must build God-centered true families in the original world free of the
Fall. To build families of true sons and daughters, we need to connect to the true lineage. To become True
Parents' children, we must connect to their lineage. The parent-child relationship, or the father-son
relationship, is absolutely impossible without the bond of blood. Not even God can sever that bond. Nor
can Satan do it.<br />
For this reason, to usher in the Completed Testament Age we must receive the marriage Blessing of True
Parents. That way we can restore through indemnity the failures of the Old and New Testament Ages.
You were an orchard of false olive trees, but now you must become an orchard of true olive trees by
receiving the graft of God's true lineage, the original standard. For this, you must achieve oneness in
heart, oneness in body and oneness in thought with True Parents, based on true love. (347-174,
2001/07/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents refer to perfected Adam and Eve. It is this Adam and Eve who come to establish true
families, true tribes, true peoples, the true nations, the true world, the kingdom of heaven on earth and the
kingdom of heaven in heaven, finally even liberating God. True Parents stand in the position to fulfill
everything on every level. They are the most precious beings that God ever sent to this world. When you
follow them with absolute faith, absolute love and absolute obedience, you are certain to overcome any
obstacle.<br />
True Parents bequeath true love, true life and true lineage. As children, we inherit these. The purpose of
all religions is to lay the foundation on earth to inherit True Parents' accomplishments. Salvation cannot
be accomplished without a connection to true love, true life and true lineage. The world is fallen because
the false parents bound humankind with false love, life and lineage, with the result that human beings fell
into hell. In order to turn this around 180 degrees, True Parents must emerge and connect humankind to
true love, true life and true lineage. The marriage Blessing engrafts cuttings from the true olive trees onto
the false olive trees. (362-011, 2001/12/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents come as the true olive trees. When the false children of this world receive a graft from
the true olive trees, they can then be harvested as restored, reborn fruits that are free from the Fall and
stored in the barns of the heavenly kingdom. This is the responsibility of the Messiah on earth. The
Messiah comes with the seed of true children based on true love. Due to the bonds of false love, false life
and false lineage that resulted from the Fall, human beings became children of the enemy Satan, children
whom God did not desire. Since they were tied to that lineage by false love, God has been conducting the
providence of salvation to purify them. (252-228, 1994/01/01)</p>

<h3 id="gods-only-begotten-son-and-daughter">God's only begotten Son and Daughter</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>God's hope for Adam and Eve was that they would grow, reach perfection and form a true family.
This is what He originally intended at the time of the Creation. God created Adam as His only
begotten Son and Eve as His only begotten Daughter. With absolute love, He invested everything
in them, and in them, He placed all His hopes.</p>
<p>However, they fell; so in their place God sent Jesus as His only begotten Son. According to the
order in which He had created Adam and Eve, God planned to restore Adam first and then to
restore Eve through Adam. Hence, first God sent Jesus as the Second Adam to take the place of
the First Adam, and then Jesus was supposed to find the original Second Eve and join with her,
becoming husband and wife. Had they succeeded in this, they would have become the True
Parents, the good first ancestors of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jesus' greatest teaching is that God is his Father and that he is God's only begotten Son. The expression
"only begotten Son" indicates that he occupied the first love of God the Father; it means he stood in the
position to receive that love. It is because Jesus stood in the position to proclaim, "I am God's only
begotten Son," that God had to make Christianity a worldwide religion. The term "only begotten Son"
emphasizes God's love. The only begotten Son is the one who is connected to the fullness of God's first
love for an individual. (138-256, 1986/01/24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Garden of Eden, Adam was God's only begotten Son and Eve was God's only begotten Daughter.
Singing together a song of spring -- "Brother, you are special to me!" and "Sister, you are so beautiful!" --
they should have grown to maturity and blossomed in the springtime of their lives. At that point, what
would God have done? When they were fully in bloom, emitting their unique fragrances, God would have
joined them together. That is, He would have held a beautiful wedding for them. Then Adam and Eve
would have realized God's supreme ideal of creation. But before this, God's only begotten Son and only
begotten Daughter first needed time to grow until they were fully mature. (159-195, 1968/05/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus called himself God's only begotten Son. The only begotten Son needs the only begotten
Daughter. Jesus was to embark on the path to save the world, but he could not do it alone. He needed to
establish his family as the foundation. Jesus' purpose in claiming to be God's only begotten Son was to
unite the world and reign over it. Yet, before he could do so, he first had to form a family of his own.
However, he could not do that in his lifetime.<br />
Therefore, in order for the Messiah to save humankind on earth, he must form a model family for others
to emulate. Jesus needed to have a family before he could try to save Israel. Jesus was God's only
begotten Son. I am sure that if Jesus' wedding had taken place, God would have been its officiator. The
greatest purpose of God's providence of salvation is to build the family that He can love. For this purpose,
Jesus, God's only begotten Son, and a specially prepared woman, God's only begotten Daughter, were to
grow in God's love while attending Him as their Father and then receive His blessing at their marriage. In
this way, they were to establish the foundation to become the true ancestors of humankind. All of this was
lost and must be recovered. (159-192, 1968/05/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title "God's only begotten Son" was finally fulfilled after Jesus came to earth. For the first time
since Adam and Eve failed and human history was lost to Satan, God's only Son, born of His lineage,
lived on earth. This was Jesus, the man who received God's love.<br />
Yet, even though Jesus emerged as God's only begotten Son, the only begotten Daughter did not appear.
The emergence of God's perfected only begotten Son after 4,000 years of the history of salvation was as if
God had created Adam again. In the Garden of Eden, God created Eve, modeling her after Adam. He
made her based on the same principle and blueprint He employed when creating Adam, so that she could
be his partner. When it states in the Bible that the woman was made from Adam's rib, it means that God
created her with the essence of Adam. That is why perfected Adam, God's only begotten Son, can recover
Eve, the one who has been lost to this day.<br />
In Jesus, God found the Adam who could establish His direct lineage of true love, but He was not yet able
to find Eve. In order to find Eve, fallen human history had to be rectified within a family, and a nation had
to be engrafted with that family. Preparation for this began with Jacob, from whom emerged the 12 tribes
of Israel. Based on the faith of the chosen people, their descendants expanded the scope of God's victory
in the world. Over the course of 2,000 years, they formed the nation of Israel and established Judaism,
both of which were prepared for the coming of Jesus. (347-171, 2001/07/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus called fallen human beings to become God's sons and daughters, but what was most remarkable
was that he proclaimed himself God's only begotten Son. In a world where humanity had been paying
indemnity continually over thousands of years of history, this concept -- God's only begotten Son -- was a
sensation.<br />
What Jesus had to do next was to change the human lineage by reversing the positions of Cain and Abel
between himself and Judaism, and between himself and the nation of Israel. However, he was not able to
do that. Hence, although he recovered the title of God's only begotten Son, he was not able to meet God's
only begotten Daughter.<br />
That woman had been prepared, but it was not possible for Jesus to meet her without a tribal level
foundation. Beginning from Jesus' family, links connecting the individual to the family and the tribe had
to be established, so that the lineage of humankind eventually could be changed. (164-256, 1987/05/17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four thousand years after the first human ancestors, God's only begotten Son in all of heaven and earth
was born. This was blessed news. Before that, people had no way to connect with the bond of God-
centered true love. This has been the cause of bitter sorrow in people's hearts.<br />
Now, God's only begotten Son has appeared on earth! He has come as an intermediary for humankind, to
dissolve that bitter sorrow. Had he not appeared, it would have been a serious matter. There can be no
greater blessing than his coming. Therefore, all humankind and all of heaven and earth must be on his
side, even the Creator. Anyone who blocks his way will come to ruin, while anyone who welcomes him
will prosper. The appearance of the only begotten Son is a joyful day for all humanity. God sends him
first because history has been led by men. Once the only begotten Son arrives, the only begotten Daughter
then must come. (023-149, 1969/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God exists as the vertical Parent, centering on true love. The vertical is a single line. When it meets a
horizontal line, it creates a 90-degree angle where the two lines meet. Man is positioned on a line at a 90-
degree angle to the vertical; woman is likewise positioned at a 90-degree angle; and the point where man
and woman meet is at that same angle. There cannot be two different angles. The only begotten Son is the
first man in human history to receive God's love at a 90-degree angle. Someone must stand with him as
God's only begotten Daughter.<br />
The Messiah, who comes as the only begotten Son, must find the only begotten Daughter. Finding her is
not a casual matter. Since God created Eve from the body of Adam, when the Messiah comes into the
world he must find his Eve. He is the one who must recover Eve, because Eve was taken by Satan. Thus
at his return Jesus, as God's only begotten Son, must receive God's only begotten Daughter and establish a
way for man and woman to meet at a 90-degree angle. Otherwise, the fundamental problems in heaven
and on earth will never be solved. God has dual characteristics, and He can dwell only where the Son and
Daughter are one. (185-186, 1989/01/08)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the Fall of Adam and Eve, God has not just waited for the children whom He lost to return to
Him on their own. He has sought the path to free them from Satan's accusation. Can you fathom how
miserable God must have been? Can you even imagine His situation in the world where Satan played
king? He endured pain and suffering beyond description so that Jesus Christ could be born free from
Satan's accusation.<br />
Finally Jesus came. If the people of Israel had only united with Jesus, God's only begotten Son, they could
have reached beyond Rome and out to the world. Then Jesus could have become the True Parent. Instead,
because Judaism and the people of Israel were unable to fulfill their responsibility, Jesus departed with
the promise that he would return.<br />
Tragically, although after 4,000 years God had found and established His only begotten Son, He could not
similarly establish His only begotten Daughter at that time. Nevertheless, since the only begotten Son
exists, the only begotten Daughter must also exist. The providence led by Jesus and the Holy Spirit was
for this purpose.<br />
We learned from the Divine Principle that whenever the central persons or central nations fail to fulfill
their responsibility, God finds another representative to complete the task. Thus, when God was unable to
send His only begotten Daughter to Israel on account of its not fulfilling its responsibility, God raised His
only begotten Daughter elsewhere. (True Mother, 2014/07/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since God is the owner of love in the human world, God must have His family, which centers on His
love, living on earth. That family lives in God's original homeland, and it expands to a tribe, people,
nation and world of the original homeland. That is how the kingdom of heaven will finally unfold on
earth. All humanity longs for the original homeland, with its citizens in the original, perfected spiritual
state. God, too, longs for this. There, heaven and earth will meet in harmony. Everything in the universe
will rejoice in happiness. God will dance and the whole creation will dance together with Him.<br />
If such an original homeland, a place that all human beings would welcome, had emerged on earth, the
world we live in would not be filled with pain and grief. Had Adam and Eve been a son and daughter who
centered on God, namely, God's only begotten Son and Daughter, and had they become totally one with
each other and established a family in that original world, their descendants in that lineage all would have
been united in mind and body. (023-152, 1969/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus came to earth in order to transform the world into the earthly kingdom of peace, on the
foundation of the nation of Israel. Even if he had attempted to accomplish that by exercising
overwhelming power and authority, he would have been unable to do so without first having established
his own family. The ideal world, the earthly kingdom of peace, begins with one true family and is
established through an assemblage of many true families. Individuals immersed in mind-body conflicts
cannot build an ideal family. Therefore, even if Jesus had the power to conquer the world, he could not
abandon the way of heaven that had called him to raise the family that God desired, even though this
brought him to the point of death.<br />
As God's only begotten Son whose mind and body were united, Jesus was to receive God's only begotten
Daughter, whose mind and body were also united, and together they were to establish that family.
Without that family, even if the world had been transformed it would be lost again in the end. The family
is bound together by bloodline. Once a people is bound together in the one lineage of God, that people
will constitute the one people of God. (023-152, 1969/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus' purpose in coming again to earth is to find his Bride, a woman who is centered on God's love.
That woman must represent Christianity, attend the Lord as her Bridegroom on the world-level stage of
Christianity, and marry him. This establishes the realm of love of the Bridegroom and Bride. It is the
beginning of a realm of love that God can finally claim.<br />
Based on the realm of the only begotten Son, God can claim the realm of the only begotten Daughter. At
the same time, centering on this only begotten Son and only begotten Daughter, He can inaugurate the
realm of love of the Bridegroom and Bride. For the only begotten Son and the only begotten Daughter, it
does not matter how large their nation is, or that it has a long history or an amazing cultural background.
What matters is that their standard of conjugal love is such that they unite as husband and wife centering
on God.<br />
The first human beings lost this standard due to the Fall. Hence, without recovering it, everything in the
world is in vain. Therefore, the only begotten Son and the only begotten Daughter on God's side must
establish the realm of conjugal love as husband and wife. Once the realm of conjugal love is secured, the
realm of children's love will naturally be established. (138-257, 1986/01/24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus said that he was God's only begotten Son, and that God was his Father. That claim indicates that
as an individual he had received God's first love. Although God came to have His only begotten Son,
Jesus, He did not yet have His only begotten Daughter. Jesus was unable to find her.<br />
Thus, Jesus must return to meet God's only begotten Daughter, who can totally receive God's first love.
That is why the Lord at his Second Advent must celebrate the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. That is, he is
required to marry. This man who completely receives God's first love must marry a woman who
completely receives God's first love, and they must start a family together, thus restoring the positions of
unfallen Adam and Eve. (041-311, 1971/02/17)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Messiah comes in the position of the original and direct Son of God. With God's absolute love, he
brings the seed of life. To find and raise such a Son is God's primary purpose for conducting the
providence of salvation through history.<br />
The Messiah comes to earth with nothing of earthly value. He has no nation. He has virtually nothing. He
does not have a partner. Because Eve, Cain and Abel were lost, he does not have a family. That is why,
when he comes, he has to recover them all.<br />
Christianity is the bride religion and is to receive the Messiah who comes as its Bridegroom. The core
truth of Christianity is amazing. Jesus called himself God's only begotten Son. Adam was intended to be
God's only begotten Son, and Eve was intended to be God's only begotten Daughter. However, due to the
Fall, they did not become the only begotten Son and Daughter. Satan claimed the only begotten Daughter.
God's entire creation was brought to ruin and must all be recovered. As God created Eve based on Adam,
God must re-create Eve by the seed that He sends through the new Son of God. (285-024, 1997/04/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human beings start from a family. A family begins with a man and a woman becoming husband and
wife. Therefore, for the original family to begin, the only begotten Son must marry the only begotten
Daughter. The only begotten Son and Daughter were to have been the original Adam and Eve, free from
the Fall. Then they were to become True Parents and give birth to sons and daughters.<br />
As people who attend True Parents, if you want your sons and daughters to be perfected, you need to
provide them with an environment in which they learn how to live for the sake of others in the four
directions. These are represented by their grandfather, grandmother, father and mother. Children are to
live for the sake of their parents. Parents are to live for the sake of their children and also for the sake of
their own parents. Grandparents are to live for the sake of their grandchildren, and grandchildren are to
live for the sake of their grandparents. A husband is to live for the sake of his wife, and a wife is to live
for the sake of her husband.<br />
In this kind of environment the grandfather and grandmother, husband and wife, and all the siblings are
included. Following this principled model of the family, we should build a family in which we live for the
sake of each other. If we do so, this will indeed bring about the kingdom of heaven in our family. (252-
125, 1993/11/14)</p>

<h3 id="freedom-from-original-sin">Freedom from original sin</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam and Eve, the first ancestors of humanity, fell when they succumbed to Satan's temptation.
They ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus committing the original
sin. The original sin was an illicit sexual relationship. This sin defiled God's lineage. Instead of
passing down God's love through the ensuing generations, they multiplied descendants through
Satan's false love.</p>
<p>In the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew records the genealogy of Jesus Christ. It preserves a record
of how in his lineage, among the descendants of the fallen Adam, good and evil were separated
and goodness advanced. It records how, during the 4,000-year history of the providence of
restoration through indemnity, the blood connection to Satan was severed in that lineage, in
order that Jesus could be born as God's only begotten Son.</p>
<p>Thus, Jesus at birth had nothing to do with original sin. He came to this world to receive his
Bride and become the True Father, so that they could take the position of True Parents. They
were to give birth to children free from original sin, and also to give rebirth to fallen human
beings and remove their original sin. Instead, however, Jesus died on the cross due to the
disbelief of the people of Israel. Still, he left with the promise that he would come again and
complete the work he had left unfinished.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Returning Lord, who comes as the Third Adam, inherits Jesus' foundation. This
allows him to start out from the position of the Messiah and from there to attain the position of
the True Parent. When he does so, he can fulfill the mission of completing God's ideal of creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Original sin is based on sexual relationships under the realm of Satan's dominion. Jesus was born
without original sin, and thus he is free from the condition of Satan's accusation. To make this possible,
God worked to reverse the positions of Cain and Abel. Jacob reversed positions with Esau; and Perez and
Zerah's positions were switched at the time of their birth. In this way, God laid the foundation for His
victory. As a result, Jesus could be born as a man free from original sin. (022-257, 1969/05/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus is God's Son. He was born under God's dominion, free from original sin. Original sin is the
condition by which Satan accuses all human beings. Since Jesus is free of original sin, he can return to the
original position of Adam prior to the Fall. Therefore, Jesus alone could be the Second Adam, who came
to rectify Adam's failure and become the original ancestor of humankind. I am saying that he could stand
in Adam's stead. From that point on, humankind could enter a new era -- the New Testament Age. Since
Jesus was born free of original sin, he was totally free from Satan's accusation in terms of lineage. Not
only that, he subjugated Satan, the archangel. In this way, Jesus could stand tall in the position of the
original Adam. (159-206, 1968/05/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Bible we read the story of Jacob, who, to receive the blessing of his father, Isaac, cooperated
with his mother, Rebekah, to deceive his father as well as his older brother, Esau. We also read the story
of Tamar, who had sexual relations with her father-in-law, Judah, and gave birth to the twins Perez and
Zerah; it concludes with Perez and Zerah becoming the center of blessing for Judah's tribe. These stories
describe behavior that contradicts conventional morality. So why are they in the Bible?
Besides, in the first chapter of Matthew, we read of four women of questionable morals: Tamar,
Bathsheba, Rahab and Ruth. The Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament is equivalent to Genesis in the
Old Testament. Why do these blemished, unholy women appear in its first chapter? There is no way to
answer these questions unless we know the Principle teaching on the human Fall. These questions have
been answered only since the time of my coming. (211-138, 1990/12/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, was in the same position as Eve. When Adam and Eve fell, they
were like a betrothed couple. Therefore, any woman chosen to restore Eve's fall through indemnity would
also have to be betrothed to someone. In such a position, Mary had to follow the tradition of Rebekah and
Tamar. She stood in the position to inherit the tradition, representing those women who had acted to
purify the lineage. To give birth to God's child, Mary upheld God's Will at the risk of her life and
willingly went the way of sacrificing herself. Like Tamar before her, she regarded the establishment of
Israel's kingship as her supreme hope. Disregarding her own life, she strove to inherit God's Will and
bequeath it to the Son of God. She was such a historic woman. (139-304, 1986/01/31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mary pursued God's Will with more passion than any other woman. She was a courageous woman
like Tamar, who, with utter devotion and loyalty to God, willingly took whatever risk was necessary in
order to bring God's precious lineage into the world. When the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and
foretold that she would soon conceive a child, Mary said, "How shall this be, since I have no husband?"
And when the angel said, "With God, nothing will be impossible," Mary answered, "Behold, I am the
handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." (from Luke 1:34-38)<br />
Mary could not take that position without risking her own life. In accordance with the five books of
Moses, at that time, an unmarried woman who became pregnant should be stoned to death. Nevertheless,
God had Mary give birth to Jesus, because she placed God's Will above her life and her honor. Thus, for
the first time in human history, the Son of God was born. He was Jesus, born from Mary's womb in
accordance with God's Will. (035-222, 1970/10/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satan could not make any accusation against Jesus in Mary's womb because Mary did not seek to give
birth to Jesus. On the contrary, she simply obeyed the command of God and lived for His Will. Not only
that: Mary set up a victorious foundation from beginning to end, from conception to birth, so that Jesus
could be born from her womb free of accusation.<br />
Ever since the tragic history of Adam and Eve, the basis of all the struggles of humankind had their
beginning in the womb. Finally, with Mary, a child inside the womb was separated from that basis. Such
was the lineage into which Jesus was born. Therefore, at the root Jesus is different from any other
religious founder, any prophet or any world-famous religious leader. Jesus is the world-level
representative who emerged from the lineage that Satan could not accuse. Jesus was the first man to be
born in the lineage centered on God. Further, he came on the foundation of all the conditions necessary to
separate sin from human history. This makes him the first person who was born of the lineage centered on
God. Because Mary acted with the pure motivation to attend God's Will, Jesus was born on earth as the
true Son of God. (035-223, 1970/10/19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus' father was not Joseph. He was a man in the realm of the archangels on God's side; not that of
the fallen angel. He followed God's direction. Jesus could be recognized as the original Adam because
God had prepared a foundation, surpassing that of Satan's world, for him to be on God's side. It was on
that foundation that God could sow His seed of life and Jesus could inherit God's realm of heart. Jesus
was born in such a position, from a seed that had been separated from Satan's lineage. Such a person had
never before existed in history. That is why Jesus could be the Messiah and the Savior of humankind.
Because he was the first human being born from a God-centered bond of love, he can rightly be called
God's only begotten Son. (169-195, 1987/10/31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus came on the national level with the authority of the king of kings. He inherited the victorious
historical foundation of a lineage changed from Satan's to God's. Therefore, although Jesus was conceived
in Mary's womb, Satan could not claim, "He is my son." Mary stood on the national level when she
conceived Jesus. She conceived him based on the foundation of Israel's history, which passed down to her
the tradition of Tamar's heart. Mary paid the indemnity of heart and, by doing so, rectified the mistake of
Eve. She stood among those women of Israel whose course was to bear sons dedicated to the change of
lineage. She conceived Jesus based on the completion of the restoration of the elder son. For these
reasons, from the time of his conception, Satan could not claim Jesus as his son.<br />
From the moment of his conception in Mary's womb, Jesus stood on the foundation of a lineage that was
already purified through this process in history. Hence, Satan could not claim Jesus as his son, even
though Jesus was conceived with the authority of the elder son that Satan had always coveted. God could
not establish His right of primogeniture unless His Son, who could claim his own right as the elder son
even while inside his mother's womb, was born on earth. That Son was Jesus. He was the first person in
history since the Fall who represented God's heart. Among all people, he could inherit this most deeply.
Therefore, Jesus was able to declare, "I am God's only begotten Son." Because he was the one who
restored the authority of the elder son centered on love, he could be the Messiah. (139-309, 1986/01/31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus came to earth based on the foundation of a process to purify the lineage. The change of lineage
was attained in the time of the twins: first, by Jacob's efforts with Esau to restore the right of the elder son
and then by Perez and Zerah, who fought in the womb of their mother, Tamar, and reversed the positions
of the older and the younger.<br />
This is recorded in the Bible. The Bible is revelatory. It is a book of treasures that can never be left out of
the history of culture, religion or the world. Hidden within it are the sagas and secrets of human history,
and matters to be untangled. These must be resolved. That is why we must restore the lineage. Jesus, who
was born from Mary's womb, changed the fallen lineage of Satan's world. He came from the position
where his lineage already had been changed. Accordingly, his Bride, his partner, also had to go through
the process of changing her lineage. (140-149, 1986/02/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The True Parents about whom the Unification Church speaks are human beings, a man and a woman.
That man and woman must be centered on God. Since Adam and Eve became the false parents, True
Parents must come in their place and become the good parents. In other words, since it was due to their
failure to reach perfection that Adam and Eve became the false parents, True Parents must be able to
stand in their place, in the position of having perfected themselves centering on God.<br />
Originally, God's ideal at the time of the Creation was for Adam and Eve to reach perfection and become
the True Parents. That position must be rectified and the original ideal must be attained. I am the one who
is pursuing that ideal.<br />
In the Unification Church, people call us True Father and True Mother. In external appearance there is no
difference between us and you; however, our root, our origin, is different from yours. The True Parents
emerged with God as the root, the first such human beings in history. We have come as the central people
of the Unification Principle and we introduce it with true love. (148-040, 1986/10/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lineage cannot be accused by Satan. If it could, I would not be able to accomplish anything. I
conduct the marriage Blessing to transfer that lineage to you. It is what you inherit from us in our
positions as the Bride and Bridegroom, which were set up and transferred to us by Jesus who has been
working hard for nearly 2,000 years after his death and has now returned. The marriage Blessing is the
ceremony of the Unification Church that creates blessed families. Once you receive the marriage
Blessing, the gate to the kingdom of heaven is always open. Satan cannot accuse you once you are
blessed. (054-270, 1972/03/25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ever since the Fall, the bodies of all human beings have been dominated by sin, all kinds of sins. This
is because human beings are connected to Satan's lineage. How can we deny it? The way to resolve this is
to follow the course of indemnity. Now we, True Parents, have paid off everything. We paid indemnity on
all levels -- the individual, family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos. We indemnified them all, and
thereby connected them all to the true lineage of God.<br />
This means you are now in the position of small messiahs. As True Parents, we belong to the lineage of
God, not to Satan's lineage. Our root is different from yours. Your roots are on the side of Satan, while
our root, the root of the Parents, is with God. As True Parents, we inherited God's original love, which is
true love, and we are connecting it to you. Once you are engrafted with us, you belong to True Parents,
who belong to God. (146-302, 1986/07/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I, True Father, gained victory over Satan's world by going through eight vertical stages, from servant
of servants to servant, adopted child and so on, and eight horizontal stages, from individual to family,
tribe, people, nation, world, cosmos and God.<br />
When Adam committed the original sin, he entered Satan's realm. He can return to his original position
only when that sin is removed. However, he cannot clear original sin by himself. Only True Parents can
do it, with true love. That is what I did, clearing it on all eight stages.<br />
Adam fell at the age of 16. Before he reached that age, he was the original Adam. Before the Fall, he was
an original young man heading for perfection, who could have inherited everything from God. I came as
the Lord at the Second Advent to inherit everything that he could not.<br />
I fought Satan at every stage -- individual, family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos -- and expelled
Satan from each. I resolved the fundamental problem of sin. I am saying that I have uprooted original sin.
Beginning at the age of 16, I took the position of victorious Adam, having nothing to do with the world of
the fallen Adam. Ever since then I have labored to recover all humankind. (265-142, 1994/11/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was born as a farmer's son in a Korean village, but my origin is different. Some people know things
intuitively from their birth, and others learn by studying. I knew the fundamental truths from birth, not by
studying. I learned them from heaven. I was born for heaven's will, and I knew them from birth. I even
came to know the heart of God. This is why, despite all kinds of opposition from the world, I could
survive until now. (542-285, 2006/10/23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you come into total oneness with God, God links you to the preparations He has made in
advance for you. When you reach that level, the spirit world will teach you directly. I met someone who
testified that he had been attending me even before my birth, before ever meeting me personally. That
person was much older than I was and had been serving me even before I was born. This was possible
because God predestined my coming. When God sends a central person into the world, He works by
giving to people visions that resemble that person in both internal nature and external form. Thus, even
before my birth, He gave people visions of my appearance. (028-094, 1970/01/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My birth on earth was not as just the son of an ordinary family. From the age of ten, I learned
everything about the world. Hence, I was well known in my clan and throughout the village. I was born
on the basis of heavens preparation over thousands of years. On that foundation, I could understand the
world. Even before I was born, elderly people who were spiritually open experienced me guiding them.

<blockquote>
<p>Due to his death on the cross, caused by disbelief among the people, Jesus was unable to
complete the path of the True Parent on earth. After his resurrection, therefore, Jesus had to find
a spiritual Bride; this was none other than the Holy Spirit. Then, with Jesus as the spiritual True
Father and the Holy Spirit as the spiritual True Mother, they could carry out the providence of
salvation in a limited way, by giving spiritual rebirth to fallen human beings.</p>
<p>In order to complete the providence of salvation both spiritually and physically, Jesus needs to
come again. Therefore, Jesus at his Second Coming needs to be born on earth in the flesh as the
Lord at the Second Advent, the Third Adam. Then he needs to receive as his Bride, the woman
whom God prepared as the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Together they become the substantial
True Parents, who can give rebirth to humanity both spiritually and physically. The True Parents
remove original sin from humankind. They offer the grace of rebirth -- the change of lineage --
opening the way to complete salvation in spirit and flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adam failed to fulfill the Will, so God sent Jesus in his place. That is why the Bible identifies Jesus as
the Second Adam. Since the first human ancestors were lost, Jesus had to restore the true ancestor. Thus,
Jesus came as the True Father of humankind, and the Holy Spirit came as the True Mother of humankind.
Thus, they established the True Father and the True Mother, spiritually. God's purpose for the Second
Advent is to manifest True Parents on earth substantially.<br />
The Last Days are the time when God's True Son and True Daughter emerge to stand in front of
humankind. Human beings lost their true ancestors and became fallen descendants, disconnected in their
lineage from True Parents. Hence, the Last Days are the time for the True Parents to recover the
descendants who were lost, by reversing the course of the Fall. (007-116, 1959/07/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus, the center of Christianity, is the Bridegroom. He receives his Bride at the Marriage Supper of
the Lamb. The Marriage Supper of the Lamb refers to the wedding of two human beings in the flesh: a
man and a woman in the positions of Jesus and the Holy Spirit.<br />
For Christians, God is the Father and Jesus is the Son. The Holy Spirit is the mother spirit. Thus, by
receiving the Holy Spirit we are reborn. We must be given rebirth by the Holy Spirit. Human beings are
born through their parents' unity in love. This is natural law. Jesus is the father; the Holy Spirit is the
mother. In other words, Jesus is the Bridegroom and the Holy Spirit is the Bride. When the Holy Spirit
comes into your heart, if your yearning heart unites with the Holy Spirit's yearning heart for Jesus, you
will be enraptured. The spirit of love from the spiritual True Parents -- Jesus and the Holy Spirit -- will
then infuse you with new life. This is what Christianity calls rebirth. (019-202, 1968/01/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Father is the perfected Adam. Since Adam fell and could not become the True Parent of
humankind, we are the descendants of false parents. For this reason, the Messiah must come as the True
Parent. More precisely, he is the True Father. Christianity speaks about the Trinity. In fact, Jesus is the
True Father and the Holy Spirit is the True Mother. That is why human beings can be reborn through
them. Children cannot be born unless their parents first make love.<br />
Hence, it says in the Book of Revelation, "The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come.' And let him who hears
say, ‘Come.' And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price."
(Rev. 22:17) This speaks to the day when the Holy Spirit comes in the flesh at the time of the Second
Advent. That is the day when the Bride is made ready for the wedding. It is the day of the Marriage
Supper of the Lamb, when children welcome and attend the True Parents who had been lost. (007-158,
1959/08/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus is the father, and the Holy Spirit is the mother spirit. We should be moved by the mother spirit.
Because of Eve, the mother, we were lost. Therefore, the perfect mother spirit must come to us and purify
our minds and bodies. Then we should experience becoming one with the perfected father spiritually.
Only by having such an experience can we be reborn. We read in the Bible, "Blasphemy against the Holy
Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but
whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
(Matt. 12:31-32) The Holy Spirit is the mother spirit. A person is born by coming out of his or her
mother's womb. But because something went wrong with our birth, we need a second birth. That is, since
we were born from false love, we need the mother spirit to give birth to us again with true love. (245-027,
1993/02/28)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for Jesus to have a family foundation, he should have received his Bride -- the woman who
came as the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Had he received that woman who embodied the Holy Spirit,
he could have worked freely on the horizontal level. However, Jesus was able to set this condition only
spiritually, because his three core disciples failed to meet the standard of becoming his sons. This was
Jesus' bitter sorrow.<br />
Since people on earth were not able to make an adequate indemnity condition, Jesus had to ascend to
heaven prematurely. Man represents heaven and woman represents earth. Jesus, the True Father of
humankind, has been in heaven. The Holy Spirit is the True Mother of humankind. Therefore, the Holy
Spirit must come to earth in the flesh. However, God's only begotten Daughter was not able to emerge at
the time of Jesus, and that Will could not be fulfilled. (023-176, 1969/05/18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is a place where men and women enter together with their families. However,
when Jesus came to earth he could not find his Bride, and he died without being able to have children.
Hence, to this day he remains in Paradise, where for 2,000 years he has been praying and working
through the Holy Spirit.<br />
In the beginning, a woman first committed sin. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, a feminine spirit, must come to
the world as an actual woman and cleanse that sin. This will happen when Jesus comes again to the world
as the Bridegroom and furnishes the new seed. Through reviving Jesus' mission, God's purpose is to build
a new God-centered world based on the lineage of the True Parents of the new heaven and earth. When
that world becomes manifest, we can say that God's Will has been fulfilled as planned. (021-199,
1968/11/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Holy Spirit that Christianity speaks of actually refers to the mother spirit, the Second Eve. Since
Eve, the mother of all human beings, fell, God sent the Holy Spirit, the mother spirit, as the Second Eve.
If we find a hole in a wall, we have to fill it in. If we lose something, we have to look for it where we lost
it. Likewise, since it is because of Eve that all human beings on earth entered the realm of death, we need
the Holy Spirit to come to earth and labor to give birth to us again. In the Bible, we read that women can
be saved through giving birth. (I Tim. 2:15) This does not refer to women living on earth today, but to
Eve.<br />
Had Eve not fallen but become the true ancestor of humankind, she would have given birth to good
children. Instead, she fell and gave birth to Satan's children. Therefore, the Holy Spirit embraces
humankind and labors to give them rebirth. Only when that labor is finished will Eve be saved and the
mission of the Holy Spirit come to an end. (009-138, 1960/05/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spirit and the flesh were separated due to the Human Fall; they must be reunited. After his
resurrection, Jesus came to earth and laid the foundation for the Holy Spirit to come. Yet that was not
enough. Jesus left promising to return. To keep that promise he must come again. The purpose of Jesus'
coming again is to find the mother in the flesh, who was lost in the Garden of Eden. Then the Parents, in
both spirit and flesh, can finally emerge among human beings as the mediators between heaven and earth.
The full achievement of Jesus' hope will be possible in the world of the one ideal, a world in which the
spirit and the flesh are united. (005-072, 1958/12/21)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We live in a time when women can move the world for God's providence of restoration. This indicates
that the time has come when Eve can emerge to restore the world. This Eve is the embodiment of the
Holy Spirit and the representative of all women on earth. She must become a true wife and a true mother;
then she must become a true queen. Therefore, she will be equipped with the qualities to become such a
person. Her character will be such that she can take responsibility for all three of these roles, and more.
God has sought for such a woman, who can become a true mother, a true wife, a true queen, and more.
Once God calls her, this woman should be able to reject Satan's world and march bravely forward. (093-
040, 1977/05/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must understand how arduous the course was to place Mother in her position in the providence of
restoration. Just to find one man, Adam, all kinds of bloody struggles and innumerable conflicts were
intertwined throughout history. Likewise, in order to find True Mother, you cannot imagine how great a
price had to be paid, how many sacrifices were necessary. In order to set and maintain the standard
necessary for True Mother to be found, people thousands of years ago received revelations, and prepared
people had to inherit those and bequeath them from generation to generation. That is how we have arrived
at this time. As if passing a candle flame from one candle to the next, countless people guarded that holy
light to make sure that it did not go out, giving their utmost devotion right up until the Last Days. You
cannot imagine what an enormous price has been paid, the uncountable sacrifices that have had to be
made. (264-056, 1994/10/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term "Holy Spirit" refers to the spiritual mother. Jesus, in unity with the Holy Spirit, multiplied
spiritual children and laid the worldwide foundation that is Christianity. Yet, since the worldwide
foundation of Christianity was laid only on the spiritual level, this foundation is not sufficient for us to
fulfill God's Will spiritually and physically. Thus, we come to the conclusion that Jesus must return. It is
inevitable, because the physical world remains imperfect. Unless the spiritual foundation of Christianity is
connected to the foundation that Jesus at his Second Coming builds in the physical world, we cannot go
beyond our current history and begin a new history, that of God's world, in the spirit and the flesh. (073-
241, 1974/09/22)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus tried to restore the failure in Adam's family on the national level. However, the people in Israel
did not believe Jesus and he was killed. Thus, Cain and Abel emerged on the national level, and this has
expanded to the world. Jesus was not able to reach beyond the national level, and he left the earth with
bitter sorrow in his heart. Therefore, he developed only God's spiritual nation and had no earthly nation.<br />
The Holy Spirit, the mother spirit, has no form, yet can be likened to an anointing with oil, water, or the
wind, which comes to people and moves their hearts. By doing so, the Holy Spirit has been working to
create the Bride, who will come in the flesh. It is on that foundation that in my time I was able to establish
Mother on the world level. Through this, True Parents can achieve the liberation of the physical realm.
(407-180, 2003/05/15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For True Mother to emerge, there had to be preparation for three generations -- her maternal
grandmother, her mother, Daemonim (Hong Soon-ae), and True Mother. Without it, she would not be
able to stand in the position of True Mother. Her grandmother brought her family to the Holy Lord
Church. Her mother brought them to the Inside the Womb Church, and then in the South they lived a
nomadic life searching for the Returning Lord. Mother was raised while leading such a life. (541-211,
2006/09/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Father cannot marry just any woman. The Eve whom he can take as his Bride must be prepared
through three generations. True Mother went through such a course. She inherited the foundation of the
Holy Lord Church, where she received the blessing of Rev. Kim Seong-do, who was in the position of the
First Eve. Following that, she also gained the foundation of the Inside the Womb Church, where she
received the blessing of Rev. Heo Ho-bin, who was in the position of the Second Eve. It was Daemonim
who made this possible.<br />
In accordance with the law of restoration through indemnity, having gone through that course, Mother
was responsible to stand on that victorious foundation and attend the Returning Lord. The reason Jesus
could not marry was because the proper condition had not been established according to the law of
restoration through indemnity. (265-153, 1994/11/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The True Parents emerged on the foundation of unity between Cain and Abel. The time having arrived
when the True Parents could appear, the Holy Spirit in the position of the mother and Jesus in the position
of the father finally descended from heaven to earth and fulfilled the marriage Blessing substantially, as
the True Father and True Mother in the flesh. That is what happened in 1960, when True Parents formed
their family. They began engrafting people with the true lineage and multiplied blessed families
throughout the world. They subjugated even Satan by establishing the realm of liberation in the spirit
world, connected to the realm of liberation on earth. (333-015, 2000/09/24)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the True Parents have emerged on earth, Jesus is united with True Father and the Holy Spirit
is united with True Mother.<br />
Jesus' mother, Mary, and John the Baptist's mother, Elizabeth, did not cooperate with each other; this was
a contributing cause of Jesus' death. At that time, the entire nation of Israel and all the leaders of Judaism
should have joined together to support Jesus, and in particular, they should have found Jesus' Bride. Then,
Jesus and his Bride could have given rebirth to humankind.<br />
What could not be done in Jesus' time on the national level must be indemnified, this time on the world-
level stage. It is True Mother's work to reach the world level; then the work must be expanded
horizontally. That is why Mother is traveling and being proclaimed throughout the world. It is because
every human being must return to True Mother's womb and become one with True Father, like the joining
of ovum and sperm, and be reborn. (235-252, 1992/09/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fallen families there are mothers and children, but the men in those families are in the position of
archangels. Therefore, men must unite with True Father, the one in the position of Adam. All the women
of the world must become second selves of True Mother and unite with True Father from that position.
By making those conditions, it is as if they have become True Father's original sons and daughters. This is
how they can be reborn and restored.<br />
You need to stand in the position of having been reborn as sons and daughters of True Father. By this, I
mean that you need to even enter Adam's bone marrow before Adam and Eve were married, and exist
there as if you are his seed. Then you, as that seed, must connect to Mother through their true love for
each other. The spark of that connection is like the electricity flowing from a disused power station when
its power is switched on again. That is why I say that you need to be reborn through true love. Mother is
the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. (243-224, 1993/01/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the sons and daughters of True Mother, the woman who represents the world. Especially you
women who follow Mother, you should become Mother's second selves. You should love her more than
you do your own husbands. Mother is the Holy Spirit. The Bible teaches that if you betray the Holy
Spirit, you cannot be forgiven. There is no way for you to be reborn. Even though she wants to forgive
you, you have no basis on which to be forgiven. Mother is the one who resurrects your life. She gives you
rebirth and then she blesses you. (233-087, 1992/07/30)</p>

<h3 id="lord-savior-and-messiah">Lord, Savior and Messiah</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>True Parents stand before fallen humanity as the embodiments of God's true love. True Parents
are the central persons who will accomplish the work of the Returning Lord and carry out God's
providence of salvation. They have the mission of the Savior and Messiah, to guide humanity
from false love and the evil lineage to true love, true life and true lineage, and to unite all
religions and all peoples.</p>
<p>True Parents come to build the original world. In that world, people will establish a new culture
by inheriting the tradition of families that are centered on True Parents. Since they will be united
with God and engage with one another by giving and receiving perfect love, people will not need
a savior. Since they do not have original sin, every family -- parents, husband and wife, and
children -- will be able to live eternally with God. This is the ultimate destination toward which
God has been leading the providence through history. When it comes to pass, the purpose of
God's providence of restoration will be fulfilled and the ideal world that humankind desires will
be realized.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The goal of the providence of restoration is for God to settle on earth. Yet the foundation for the
fulfillment of that goal on earth was lost. Regardless, God takes responsibility to restore what was lost
and to fulfill it. He has led the providence of restoration in pursuit of this goal. The purpose for which
God sends the Messiah is to find the perfected husband and wife. This purpose is the same, whether in the
Old Testament Age or the New Testament Age. Just as the realm that Jesus established in the New
Testament Age had to fulfill the Old Testament Age, the realm that True Parents establish in the
Completed Testament Age must fulfill the New Testament Age. Thus, the realm of the Completed
Testament Age includes the fulfillment of the Old and the New Testament Ages.<br />
Jesus came to fulfill the Old Testament Age, and if he had, all could have been united. This unity should
have occurred in the New Testament Age with Jesus as the center. However, because it did not happen,
the fulfillment was prolonged to the era of the Second Coming. That is why the Completed Testament
Age that begins with the Second Coming must fulfill the Old and New Testament Ages. The Lord at the
Second Advent will fulfill everything. His coming inaugurates the fulfillment of the historical eras -- the
Old Testament, the New Testament and the Completed Testament Ages. (250-325, 1993/10/15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Adam and Eve fell and inherited the enemy's love, life and lineage, they destroyed everything
that God had intended for them. At the time of Jesus, had the spiritual world and the physical world,
represented by the leaders of Judaism and Israel, united with him on the national level, there would have
been no need for the Second Israel. Jesus should have united the spiritual world and the physical world, as
well as Israel and even the Roman Empire. However, because this did not happen, after a prolongation of
2,000 years, now I have to go one level higher. I have to break down all the barriers, including the walls
that were erected by the failure in Jesus' family, as well as by the failure in Adam's family. I have to break
down the barriers that have blocked good cooperation between the spiritual world and the physical world,
and the barriers in the spiritual world that have confined people to paradise (a realm lower than the
highest heaven) and even to hell.<br />
To enable this to happen, God is proclaiming, "Sun Myung Moon is the Savior! He is the Messiah! He is
the Lord at the Second Advent!" Once you meet the True Parents, you do not need a Savior, a Messiah, or
a Lord at the Second Advent. They are all included in the True Parents. (471-213, 2004/10/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents are the Savior. They have come to save the world. Since the false parents gave birth to a
world of false love, True Parents need to save the world with true love. The Messiah also brings unity
among the religions. When the religions are united centering on true love, they will form one great family.
The world is advancing to establish this great family; only in this way, can there be true peace.<br />
All religions are advancing to bring about peace, which comes from unity. Furthermore, the First Israel,
which is the Jewish nation, and the Second Israel, which is Christianity, must pass beyond the First Adam
and the Second Adam and advance centering on the Third Adam, in order to rectify all of their failures on
the family level, the national level and the world level. Once the True Parents stand firmly on that
foundation, they will finally recover all that was lost in the earthly world, as well as what was lost in the
spirit world.<br />
The True Parents are the king and queen among those who can save the world. They are the king and
queen among messiahs. They are the king and queen of the Old Testament Age, the New Testament Age
and the Completed Testament Age and the representatives and the embodiments of the invisible God. The
True Parents were born for the sake of God, not for themselves. That is why even God exists for the True
Parents. God and True Parents are one in true love. (399-178, 2002/12/23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At his coming to earth, the Messiah and Savior must liberate all humankind from hunger and from the
tribulations in their nations. Yet, among the things he must liberate them from, which is the most
important? The first is to liberate them from false love. The Savior is the liberator of love, the liberator of
life, and the liberator of the lineage.<br />
People are suffering because their lineage has changed from God's to Satan's. If all of humankind had the
same lineage, stemming from God, everyone would be siblings, loving one another centered on God.
However, their lineage was changed. Thus, the core mission of the one who comes as the Messiah and
Savior is to liberate all people by changing their lineage. (194-011, 1989/10/15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had we human beings not fallen, we would know God. Knowing Him in our hearts, we would
naturally know how to live, no matter what the world says. Our body would unite with our mind; they
would not struggle with each other. Our mind and body meet at the wrong angle as a result of the Fall. In
order to align them properly, the religious world teaches us to strike our body. That is why people do all
kinds of penance: fasting, serving others before ourselves, living a sacrificial life, even shedding their
own blood for heaven. Unless we put ourselves through such painful situations, we cannot return to our
original position. Not only must we align mind and body within ourselves as individuals, we must do so
on the family, national and world levels. The Messiah comes as the model to teach the world how to align
at every level, centered on true love. (178-190, 1988/06/04)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People will not believe that I am the Returning Lord, the Messiah and True Parent just because you or I
say it is so. My authority to stand as the Lord should be based on actual achievements. Until I overcame
Satan's world and established a foundation with certifiable evidence upon which I could stand, there was
no basis for people to come to their own realization that I am the Messiah and True Parent.<br />
I endured numerous ordeals and difficulties as I strove to establish a foundation on which I could stand
and be recognized as the Messiah and True Parent in both heaven and on earth. I had to lay such a
foundation so that people would acknowledge me as the Messiah and the True Parent throughout the
entire cosmos. Unless I could do that, I could not make that claim. That is why I have done so many
things in my lifetime. I did things that no individual could dream of doing. I did what even nations cannot
do. (396-265, 2002/11/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could not just come to the decision "I am the Messiah" on my own. I could not carry out the Messiahs
mission based on my personal views. Rather, all my circumstances led me to the self-awareness that I had
been called to fulfill the responsibility of being the Messiah. There was no other way I could go. The
potential for the Fall began from the moment, when in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve came to have
self-awareness. It is the same with restoration.<br />
I could not meet the standard of the Messiah just by words. Nor could I meet it just because God blessed
me to be the one. Although God had blessed me, I still had to establish the necessary foundation by
substantiating His blessing. This meant that I had to reach the level where I could live with God and be in
the realm where God and I were relating as equals. When I had secured this in reality, I could receive the
inheritance and the title of "Messiah." I could inherit everything from God by reaching the level of equal
participation, equal position, and living together with Him. He had to recognize me by saying, "Certainly
you are the True Parent; certainly you are the Messiah."<br />
I had to become like a lighthouse that gives out light to ships in the night. As a lighthouse lights up the
darkness so that ships can find their way with certainty, the Messiah must be able to shine a bright light
into a world engulfed in darkness, a light that shines no matter how dark it is. (396-023, 2002/11/02)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things belong to God. I am saying that God is the Owner of all things. Yet Satan thus far has been
acting as if he were the owner. In a relationship of love where there is a sense of equality and balanced
participation, the two parties cede control to each other. Blessings and the authority of inheritance are also
involved. Therefore, after the first human beings formed a love relationship with Satan, all things ended
up belonging to Satan's realm. Satan usurped God's throne and sat on it. He invaded even the environment
around God Himself, ruling over everything.<br />
There was no way God could liberate Himself from this situation. Nor could anyone else liberate Him,
even after the passing of thousands of biblical years. That is why God underwent so many hardships in
order to restore human beings to the standard that He had envisioned for the original family.<br />
With my birth, for the first time in human history everything in God's environment that Satan had defiled
could be cleaned up. I cleaned up that environment front and rear, and right and left, and by establishing
the measures and formulas to defend God from Satan's realm. Consequently, Satan had no choice but to
retreat. Anyone who objects to this will meet with difficulties. I am saying that True Parents have
succeeded in doing all of this. We have established a victorious realm on the individual level and on the
family level. (290-103, 1998/02/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I devoted my entire life to abolishing hell and the middle realms in the spirit world and to opening the
gates to the kingdom of heaven. I took it as my destiny to resolve this problem. Even if I do not talk about
this, I should be able to command people on the foundation that those in my surroundings recognize me
and attend me. Even without my saying that I was the True Parent, people received messages directly
from the spirit world that I was the True Parent, the Messiah and the Returning Lord, and they testified
about this.<br />
There can be plenty of messiahs, true parents and saviors on the individual level, but the individual level
alone is not sufficient. Heaven and earth should publicly recognize that I am the Messiah on the cosmic
level. The spirit world should testify, "He is the Messiah and our True Parent." True Parents should stand
on the victorious foundation of uniting the spirit world. (396-265, 2002/11/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After representing his nation, the Messiah comes as Abel to the world. Hence, once he has met the
national-level condition to indemnify the history in which Cain killed Abel, on that foundation he finally
can come to the world in the position of the True Parent.<br />
Had those of the Jewish faith and nation united to support Jesus and to establish the national foundation
by rectifying the history in which Cain murdered Abel, Jesus could have stood in the position of the True
Parent. In the history of restoration, after siblings become one, the Parents can emerge.<br />
On the national level, Judaism and the people of Israel should have become one to support Jesus, and the
leaders of Judaism and the chief priests should have united to support Jesus. Then they would have
restored the Cain-Abel relationship on the national level, and on that national foundation, the Messiah
could have emerged. That was Jesus. Had the people of Israel united with the Messiah, it would have
resolved on the national level the division between Cain and Abel that stemmed from Adam in the Garden
of Eden. Then the Messiah could have married and become the True Parent and, with the new, God-
centered family structure, emerged on the world level. (074-083, 1974/11/14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After World War II, the United States brought the entire world under the realm of the elder son,
thereby establishing the authority of the firstborn son. However, in addition to that, the authority of the
Parents and the authority of God's kingship have to be established. For this, the United States will have to
attend True Parents. The United States established the right of the firstborn son, but does not yet know
True Parents.<br />
In order to restore God's kingship, the United States must attend the Lord at his Second Advent, the True
Parents. That is why One Nation under God is not enough. Now that the True Parents have come, we have
to build One World under God, One Universe under God and One Cosmos under God. When such a
world emerges, the kingdom of heaven on earth will be realized.<br />
In the free world, people do not have the concepts One World under God, One Universe under God and
One Cosmos under God. In the Last Days, when God's Will is to be realized, True Parents will come to
earth and establish one world, one universe and one cosmos under God by restoring the authority of God
as the Parent and God as the King.<br />
Jesus was unable to complete restoration on the national level in Israel and to realize the ideal of One
Nation under God. Therefore, I came to the United States, the summit of the world, in order to restore his
ideal of one nation under God. However, this ideal does not include the spirit world. It does not include
even the whole of the physical universe, not to mention the cosmos. It is not One Unified Spiritual World
and Physical World under God. That is why the Lord at the Second Advent must come to realize that
world. Had Jesus established One Nation under God and united even the Roman Empire, he could have
established one world. And had he united also the spirit world, he could have established One Cosmos
under God. Since this work was not completed, it remains to be fulfilled. No one has known about this;
only God and the Returning Lord know it. (311-116, 1999/08/29)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Messiah comes as the Father. If he comes as the older brother, his siblings will fight him. Only
when he comes as the Parent can he bring an end to conflict. Thus, the title "True Parents" is amazing,
because when people have their True Father and True Mother, there can be true love among them. From
True Parents, centering on true love, true children can be born. Then a true family can emerge, and when
it expands horizontally, it can become a true tribe, people, nation, world and the true cosmos, in which
God can dwell. There is no disputing this logic.<br />
True Parents never existed in the past, nor will there ever be another set of True Parents. What joyful
news it is that the one and only True Parents to ever exist in history have emerged at this time! There can
be no greater news than this, ever! It is especially great when you enter a parent-child relationship with
True Parents and bond with their lineage; this enables you to inherit their authority without any sense of
shame. They will guide you beyond yourselves to the infinite world.<br />
You have no idea how remarkable it is that you know the name "True Parents." God created human
beings with this as His vision for them. True Parents' love makes the connection from true families to the
true world, the true kingdom of heaven on earth and the true kingdom of heaven in heaven. (266-250,
1995/01/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the foundation of True Parents' victory, we are going beyond the Fall and entering the age
when we can proclaim the era of liberation and complete freedom in the new kingdom of heaven on earth
and in heaven. This is the proclamation that the time has come when we can enter the realm that has
nothing to do with the Fall.<br />
That is why the spiritual world and the physical world will have to unite. Unless you know the spirit
world, you will fall away. God, together with all the world-level religious founders, saints and sages, and
great people in the spirit world have resolved to work for the unity of these two worlds. Those dwelling in
paradise and even in hell have resolved to support this and they have declared this Liberation.<br />
I therefore am working to bring this same understanding and determination to people on earth. With the
coming of earth's true owner, the one who is the Savior, Messiah and Returning Lord, everything is
completed. Centering on the name of the True Parents, everyone can cross over into the new world of
liberation and live together with God, united in love. We have entered the era in which God can descend
from His throne and live with His children on earth, where He will personally involve Himself with their
lives.</p>

<h3 id="completion-of-the-providence">Completion of the providence</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>God must continue His providence of restoration through history until He restores through
indemnity fallen Adam and Eve and installs the True Father and True Mother of all humankind --
the True Parents. The True Parents come as the sole, central model of God's ideal. They extend
their hands to save fallen people and show them the direction in which to go. They come at the
time when the history of God's providence bears fruit, when history can be made straight and
begun anew.</p>
<p>Looking at all the efforts of the True Parents, we see that they have rectified historical failures,
are uniting a divided world into one and based on this, are building the kingdom of heaven. True
Parents are the supreme and ultimate hope of humankind who complete the providence of
restoration. Thus, when they emerge and are welcomed by the world, the hope of history can be
fulfilled. The era when True Parents emerge in the world is the starting point for concluding
fallen history. (574-187, 2007/09/04)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>True Parents are God's hope. They were God's hope at the beginning of the Creation and during the
eons of time during which He created everything. They were the ultimate goal of God's efforts throughout
history, even as He led the providence of restoration through indemnity. Unless True Parents appear in
this world, history cannot be set aright. God is the center of every perfected entity based on the ideal of
love. This is true for the individual, the family, the tribe, the people, the nation and the world.<br />
By centering on the perfected Adam, God wanted to establish the foundation of His object partners and
expand it to every level on earth. However, because of Satan, everything was frustrated. Therefore, when
the True Parents come, they must build their foundation on every level, from the individual to the family,
tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos. Then, once there is unity with True Parents on every level, all
human beings can be one with God in the kingdom of heaven. This is the purpose of the providential
history of salvation. (268-163, 1995/03/31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had there been no Fall, we would not have needed such terms as True Parents, the providence of
salvation, the providence of restoration, the providence of re-creation, the providence of resurrection, and
so on. Yet, due to the Fall, the providence of salvation became necessary and humankind came to need a
Savior.<br />
The Savior is the central person who represents God to human beings and reconciles human beings to
God. He comes to correct all the mistakes of history. What he must do is eliminate Satan. God cannot do
it Himself. Satan is the archangel who was supposed to be under Adam's dominion, but he subjugated
Adam instead. Therefore, it is up to Adam to recover his original position, and it is for this purpose that
the Savior must come. By presenting the Principle and attending God, the Savior must make Satan
surrender voluntarily and return to his original position. That is the only way to achieve a foundation for
peace that accords with God's ideal of creation. (214-260, 1991/02/03)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The providence of restoration is the providence of re-creation. When God re-creates, He needs to do it
through the original Principle of Creation. The center of the original Principle of Creation is one perfected
man and one perfected woman, who become husband and wife and follow the path of love. Without
building that bridge of love, no one can go to God. This is the way based on the ideal of creation.<br />
To fulfill this, God has sought to recover the one man, Adam. Yet until now, He could not. From the day
of the Fall to this day, God has worked through religion to seek for Adam according to the principles of
re-creation. That is why the world-level religions need to uphold the teaching that their lord, who
possesses the true way, will come to earth again and guide all of humankind to the world of peace, the
ideal world. This is not accomplished by a group of people; the standard is one central person, perfected
Adam. (195-130, 1989/11/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam and Eve were to have been perfected by uniting with their Heavenly Parent. Had they united
with their Heavenly Parent, all their descendants likewise could have stood in their parents' realm of
victory. This should have unfolded through eight levels: the individual, family, tribe, people, nation,
world, cosmos and God. When Adam and Eve fell, it was only the two of them, so the Fall occurred on
the individual level. Now, however, the realm of the Fall has expanded throughout heaven and earth. Just
two individuals, Adam and Eve, fell, but the result has spread not only to the physical world but also to
the spiritual world, from earth to heaven. Only by finally achieving that realm of victory on every level
will the liberation of humankind be possible.<br />
Multitudes of religious believers have been making indemnity conditions in their efforts to escape the
realm of the Fall. However, since they themselves are descendants of the Fall, it is impossible for them to
escape on their own. Adam and Eve, the first human ancestors, caused this situation when they fell.
Therefore, it is necessary that good first ancestors come and pioneer a path to escape the situation. Unless
these new key figures succeed in overcoming the Fall, no one will be able to escape from it.<br />
It is the Returning Lord and his Bride, the True Parents, who can accomplish this. True Parents must also
bring perfection on all levels, from the individual to the family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos.
And finally, they must liberate God. (251-019, 1993/10/15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human beings originally were created as God's children, but because they inherited Satan's lineage,
they came under the rule of Satan. That is why to this day humankind has been treated as the enemy's
children. Accordingly, True Parents must recover these children for God and, in the process, become the
ancestors of humankind. They have to clean up everything that became defiled throughout human history
and put Satan in a place where he cannot make accusations. They must pave paths that Satan cannot
accuse, whether traveling from the physical world up to the spiritual world or from the spiritual world
down to earth. True Parents have to travel back and forth and overcome all the conditions that Satan can
accuse. Satan has been able to make accusations due to the mistake made by the ancestors of humankind.
Therefore, True Parents, coming as the true ancestors of humankind, must completely pave the way from
the past, to the present, and to the future. (019-205, 1968/01/07)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the beginning of human history to this day, God and Satan have been at war with each other.
God cannot stop it, nor can Satan. That war began due to the Fall of Adam and Eve. How, then, can this
situation be resolved? God intends to re-create them. The course of restoration is the course of re-creation.
Unless they are re-created, there can be no solution. That was His purpose for inaugurating religion: to re-
create Adam and Eve. Among numerous religions throughout the world, Judaism, Christianity and the
Unification Church are at the center. They comprise three stages, culminating at the time of the Second
Coming in the Last Days when True Parents will emerge.<br />
True Parents know all the secrets of God, Satan and humankind. Satan's world is full of chaos. Above and
below, right and left, and front and rear, nothing is in its proper order. At the Second Advent, True
Parents will come to earth and begin to clean this up. Starting from themselves as individuals, they will
clear the way to recover the family, tribe, people, nation, world and even the spirit world. Then God's
ideal of creation, which humankind has long awaited, will appear in the mainstream of history. Hence, the
challenge faced by the Unification Church is how to establish ourselves as the mainstream. We must build
the highway, so that everyone can travel along it and arrive at the ideal world, the kingdom of heaven. In
that ideal world, nothing can hinder anyone on the path; even Satan cannot be there. It is simply a clean
and pure world. It is a world where all people can fulfill their purpose of life. It is a world where all are
free, both in the spiritual world and in the physical world. That world is our original homeland.<br />
Due to the Fall, people have been in misery. Until the True Parents appeared on earth, no one has been
able to solve this problem. Only through their coming can everything be set straight again. (315-139,
2000/01/30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The path we have taken as True Parents has not been level and smooth. We have had to make the way
smooth across the gorges and canyons. During this time, God has been with us every step of the way.
This is why we can say that God is our Father and Mother.<br />
Jesus' disciples and Christian believers are supposed to take responsibility for the bitter sorrow that our
Heavenly Parent has been carrying for tens of thousands of years, as well as for the pain of Jesus, who
should have become the True Parent by finding his Bride on earth. Yet none of these believers are
determined to liberate our Heavenly Parent, or even Jesus, who was to have been the Parent on earth.
Most of them just want to receive blessings by believing in Jesus. When they go to the next world, they
will find themselves in trouble.<br />
All the while, God has shed tears like a waterfall. Knowing this, we, the True Parents, undertook the work
of liberating God as our mission. (357-055, 2001/10/26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Returning Lord establishes the True Parents of humankind, and they recover the realm of true
love. Then they go on to establish the position of the True Parents of Heaven and Earth. This is how they
are to complete the providence to restore humankind.<br />
The True Parents of Heaven and Earth must begin with a family in which they, as God's filial son and
daughter, attend God, honor Him and glorify Him, even better than the family of Adam and Eve would
have done had they reached perfection.<br />
The True Father, the Messiah, who is centered on true love, is the head of the family, which is the ideal
core of humankind. He is to begin history anew by connecting human beings to true life and true lineage
as they form blessed families, thus establishing the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven. (315-213,
2000/02/02)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event at which, for the first time in human history, God's chosen Bridegroom and Bride joined
together is that glorious and honored event that Christians speak of as the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
This was the event at which the Bridegroom and Bride, enraptured with eternal love, praised their eternal
life with God and its value forever. On that occasion they joined together representing myriads of people;
this was the coming together of God and original human beings.<br />
Yet, reaching the position of a bride and groom was not their ultimate goal as the original human beings.
It is just one position on their course to perfection. Parents are the beginning of life. The life of the
original human beings began in the presence of the Heavenly Parent, and all human beings must find a
way to return to their Parent, God.<br />
Those who start out as parents, the root of new life, must start from the same position in which God stood
when He gave life to the first human beings. From that position, they should grow in the realm of God's
protection and then emerge as the Bridegroom and Bride. After that, by becoming parents they can return
to the Heavenly Parent.<br />
That is why I am saying that the positions of the Bridegroom and Bride are not the ultimate ideal.
Likewise, your final destination as human beings is the place where you attend God as your Parent and
become His true sons and daughters. Certainly that should be the summit of your hope, the place you all
should desire to reach.<br />
Based on this view, the Unification Church presents the ideal of True Parents. By going through the
process of becoming bridegrooms and brides, you also can arrive at the position of original sons and
daughters. God created human beings, but they fell. So you should be restored and reach perfection, and
by attending God as the True Parent you should attain oneness with Him in eternal value, in eternal life
and in eternal love. All of you need to start anew. This is the reason it is necessary for True Parents to
come to earth and guide humankind toward this goal following the path of restoration. God's purpose for
leading the providence of salvation for humankind thus far has been to arrive at this destination. (068-133,
1973/07/29)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be a true man and a true woman who attend God and unite with each other. They must
establish a conjugal relationship that cannot be broken, no matter what. And then they must give birth to
true sons and daughters. That man and woman are the True Parents. They are centered on God, are a true
husband and wife to each other, and give birth to true sons and daughters, thus establishing the four-
position foundation.<br />
True Parents are God's true Son and true Daughter. They are to be the center of humanity and the
universe. A nation that centers on them will become a central nation. On the other hand, a nation that
lacks that center will come to ruin, and a world that lacks that center will drift into oblivion. For this
reason, the culture that is centered on the True Parents will advance throughout the world. The culture
that starts from that center will never perish.<br />
Therefore, all families should make True Parents their center and attend God as True Parents do. All the
people of the world should live by the example of True Parents, by their value system, and in line with
their views on national and world affairs. The values they present will become widely held throughout the
nation and the world, and eventually all humankind will share these values and adopt them as their own.<br />
Humankind has proceeded in hope for the time of the Last Days and is now heading for that one gate.
True Parents' hope is to establish the God-centered true family, tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos. If
we all do this together, we can restore even God's love. (019-205, 1968/01/07)</p>

<h2 id="section-4-the-embodiments-of-god">Section 4. The Embodiments of God</h2>
<h3 id="the-vertical-parent-and-horizontal-parents">The vertical Parent and horizontal Parents</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam and Eve were created as God's substantial object partners -- Adam as the representative of
God's masculinity and Eve as the representative of God's femininity. God is the self-existent
incorporeal subject partner, whose dual characteristics are in harmony.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when He created the first human beings, one man and one woman, His purpose
was to assume a body, which He needed in order to relate with the substantial world. God wanted
to freely communicate and interact with the substantial world through the bodies of the two
human beings, Adam and Eve. This was because as long as God was an incorporeal being
without a body, He was limited in relating to the corporeal, substantial world.</p>
<p>Therefore, had Adam and Eve, on the foundation of reaching perfection by attending God and
becoming one with Him, married and had children to form a family, they would have become the
external, horizontal True Parents, and God would have become the internal, vertical True
Parent.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God exists as an incorporeal being; hence, we cannot see Him, not even after we die and go to the spirit
world. Accordingly, for God to have a relationship with human beings who are in the flesh, He needs to
manifest Himself on earth as the Father with a physical body. It is because of this natural law that God
created Adam and Eve, the first human ancestors. In and through them God intended to manifest Himself
in both incorporeal and corporeal forms. The harmony and unity between Adam and Eve in both spirit
and flesh thus would have symbolized the harmony and unity of the incorporeal world and the corporeal
world, and would have brought the cosmos into oneness.<br />
How can we human beings who were born in the flesh become the body of God, who exists as an
incorporeal being? God has four fundamental attributes: He is absolute, unique, unchanging and eternal.
God created human beings as His ultimate masterpieces, to whom He could bequeath these attributes.
However, the flesh cannot be eternal, because it is made with finite material substances based on the
principles of the physical world. Therefore, when Adam and Eve attained perfection in the flesh, God
wanted to live within them in total oneness and maintain that oneness in spirit as an eternal relationship of
true love -- God within them and they within God.<br />
Had Adam and Eve not fallen but kept God's commandment, they would have attained individual
perfection and married with God's blessing. Then their children also could have become embodiments of
God, and all human beings would have inherited God's attributes from generation to generation into
eternity. (501-032, 2005/07/14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God created human beings as His absolute object partners of love by totally investing Himself in them.
He needed substantial object partners with whom to share His love. However, not only in the earthly
world but also in the heavenly realms, He cannot fully relate to His children if He has no substantial form.
That is why He needed to assume such a form. That form is that of True Parents who have attained
perfection.<br />
God created human beings because He needed object partners with whom to share His love on earth. It is
for this reason that He endowed human beings, whom He created as His absolute object partners, with the
ability to procreate, so that they could continue their life on earth forever. Love, life and lineage are the
three elements of God's creation of human beings. God is the root of love, the root of life and the root of
lineage. He is also the root of the kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven.<br />
Had the Fall not occurred, God would have entered the hearts of Adam and Eve at the time of their
marriage and He would have experienced the union of love through their bodies. Thereby He would have
become the vertical True Parent, and Adam and Eve would have become the horizontal True Parents.
Thus, human beings would have possessed a mind that stemmed from two sets of parents: God, as well as
Adam and Eve. That mind would be the vertical self, and the body, the horizontal self. They would have
lived their lives in oneness in heart, oneness in body, oneness in thought and oneness in harmony. (565-
315, 2007/06/13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True Parents can be likened to God's body. They are Adam and Eve in perfection. Perfection means
that the vertical God and the horizontal Adam and Eve are one. Adam and Eve are like God's body, and
God is like the mind of Adam and Eve. What makes this possible is true love. In love, the vertical God
and the horizontal Adam and Eve live for the sake of each other. They represent heaven and earth. (338-
212, 2000/10/29)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless you attend God and True Parents, the value of your existence is lessened. You become true
human beings only when you are in relationship with God and True Parents, that is, with the two sets of
True Parents -- the vertical True Parent and the horizontal True Parents. It is because there is oneness
between God, the vertical True Parent, and Adam and Eve, the horizontal True Parents, that human beings
can have unity between their mind and body and thus connect to God and His kingdom. Therefore, if
people do not attend God and True Parents, they cannot achieve anything in the true sense.<br />
The heavenly realms are represented by the central family of the cosmos. When this family appears on
earth, a vertical axis is formed; and centered on that axis, concentric circles expand through eight levels.
(565-307, 2007/06/13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is the origin of life, the origin of love and the origin of lineage. Therefore, God's love, life and
lineage should be one with human beings' love, life and lineage. God is in the position of the vertical
Parent, whereas the unfallen human beings, Adam and Eve, would have been in the position of the
horizontal Parents. Adam and Eve were God's children, but at the same time, they were like brother and
sister to each other.<br />
In time, they would have become husband and wife, and later, by giving birth to children, they would
have become parents and ascended to a position next to God. By giving birth to children and then loving
them, Adam and Eve would have inherited everything from God, who rejoiced after creating human
beings, His children. Because they had received divine love, they would have loved their children more
than themselves and treasured them so much that they would never have exchanged them for all of
heaven and earth. (223-267, 1991/11/12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam's sons and daughters could not dwell within the realm of God's love. Had they been the children
of an unfallen Adam, the kingdom of heaven on earth would have been realized with them, as they made
horizontal connections on every level. But because the vertical and the horizontal did not meet together,
the kingdom could not come.<br />
Thus, as God's sons and daughters, human beings must inherit this kingdom in two realms. Through the
Blessing, you have inherited the lineage of the kingdom in heaven and the kingdom on earth, the vertical
kingdom and the horizontal kingdom, and the vertical Parent and the horizontal Parents. You have
become children who can inherit all that is internal and external from both the vertical Parent and the
horizontal Parents.<br />
Royal family members are those who actually live their lives based on this twofold inheritance -- from the
kingdom in heaven and the kingdom on earth. Once you become members of the royal family, you stand
on the foundation to be accepted by both kingdoms at any time. Then, based on this way of life, you
should expand children's love, siblings' love, love between husband and wife, and parents' love. Once
your family is officially recognized for living by this standard of love, it will become a perfect family on
earth and in heaven that receives the vertical kingdom and the horizontal kingdom as its inheritance.<br />
Those who have experienced God's internal heart and all the elements of Adam and Eve's external
substance come to belong to the realm of the royal family. Centering on true love, God is their vertical
Parent and Adam and Eve are their horizontal Parents. Their children are Adam and Eve's blood relations,
who inherit the ideal of both worlds. (240-017, 1992/12/10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we consider God to be the first generation, then True Parents are the second generation. The second
generation must receive the marriage Blessing from God, and then they must bequeath that true lineage to
their children. Otherwise, God would have no third generation. The restoration of those three generations
is the ideal that the Unification Church is pursuing.<br />
God is our vertical Father; He can connect us to the infinite spirit world. We also have a physical person
as our horizontal father. Our vertical Father is God, and our horizontal father and mother are the True
Parents. In love, God meets True Parents at a 90-degree angle at the point where they unite as husband
and wife. The place where a husband and wife become one is their reproductive organs. Except by means
of the reproductive organs, their lives cannot become one. Becoming one through that union makes the
connection of lineage.<br />
After inheriting true life centered on God's love, perfected Adam and Eve relate to each other as subject
partner and object partner. Their marriage is, at the same time, a marriage of God, the incorporeal
substantial being, and Adam and Eve, the corporeal substantial beings. Hence, on their wedding night
they will experience God's love. Thus, the marriage of the perfected Adam and Eve is not simply the
union of two human beings. Their wedding is the core event in the universe.<br />
That is why you must seek for nothing but God and True Parents. You should seek nothing else but the
love, life and lineage of God and the love, life and lineage of True Parents. (363-073, 2001/12/16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is vertical. When Adam and Eve join together horizontally at the center, they meet the vertical
God. The standard of equality between man and woman lies in the vertical. When they embrace and make
love, the vertical is present, absolutely. They whirl around, centering on that vertical axis.<br />
Love means to attain oneness. Without love, the phrases "oneness between parents and children,"
"oneness between husband and wife," and "oneness between brothers and sisters" would not exist.<br />
The bodies of man and woman are God's substantial forms. I mean that their bodies are God's body. In
their physical union, they seek to ascend in pursuit of God, the vertical standard, but in fact, it first
connects to them. The vertical standard descends quickly, as if pulled by gravity. It comes down more
quickly than the horizontal comes together. In their physical union, revolving around the vertical
standard, everything together creates a spherical form of love. The vertical becomes the core, and Adam
and Eve revolve around it like satellites to complete the spherical form of love. That is where Adam and
Eve, God's son and daughter, are perfected as God's loving embodiments. (262-189, 1994/07/23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The true vertical parent is God, and the true horizontal parents are the True Parents. Those who do not
know these parents do not have the right to inherit the cosmic realm of God's blessing. Within the realm
where hearts are bonded in true love, parents and children, God and True Parents, have equal ownership.
However, we must dearly understand that the vertical parent is God and the horizontal parents are True
Parents. (246-214, 1993/04/16)</p>

<p>Because God is the only Lord of vertical love, we call Him the vertical Parent. The original human
ancestors who have nothing to do with the Fall are the horizontal Parents. Their relationship exists at a
90-degree angle to the vertical. In whatever direction it turns, their relationship maintains its
perpendicular position, its 90-degree angle to the vertical.<br />
When there is perpendicularity between the vertical and the horizontal, no one complains even if east-
west turns to above-below. In other words, whether the wife leads her husband, or the children lead their
parents, or the grandchildren lead their grandparents, no one complains because everyone feels connected.
Right there, the realm of unity is formed. Once we have such family relationships structured around a 90-
degree angle, this creates the foundation for total oneness. There is no waste, no struggle, only peace, for
all eternity. (204-105, 1990/07/01)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the original world of creation, Adam and Eve were to reach perfection and unite completely in
true conjugal love. This would have created the basis for God to dwell within them and take His
place as the vertical True Parent of humanity. Once Adam and Eve, who resemble the
incorporeal God as His substantial object partners, had become perfected and united as one with
God, they would become the True Parents. They would have begotten children to form an ideal
family and then an ideal world.</p>
<p>Once this had come to pass, Adam and Eve, as the perfected human ancestors, would have
connected the spiritual world and the physical world. Had they become True Parents with perfect
spirit selves, God then would have become manifest in the image of Adam and Eve, the True
Parents. God would then dwell with the True Parents, perfected Adam and Eve, and His
manifestation through them would continue forever. Therefore, now that True Parents are
transforming the fallen, sinful world, restoring the original world of creation, and establishing
the nucleus of the ideal world, they have become the eternal image of God, on earth and in the
spirit world.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God divided His dual characteristics to create Adam and Eve as the embodiments of His original
internal character and original external form, with man the embodiment of His original masculinity and
woman the embodiment of His original femininity. In the same way, all beings in heaven and on earth are
manifestations of God.<br />
God is a being of dual characteristics in harmony. In terms of position and status, He is the subject partner
and in the male position.<br />
When God enters the True Parents, who become His embodiments, God and the True Parents then
become one in lineage, love and life. In the position of total oneness with God, as families of the heavenly
kingdom, as inheritors of the world where God is transcendent over all, immanent in all, and omnipotent,
where the ideal of creation has been completed, each of you must occupy the position of families that are
owners in the heavenly kingdom of eternal life. God wants that world, the world that achieves substantial
victory both spiritually and physically. (602-258, 2008/11/16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did God create human beings? First, He wanted object partners to love. He created Adam and
Eve to multiply and fill His kingdom with those who were His physical manifestations, who would
eventually come to live with Him in the kingdom of heaven.<br />
In order for you to go to this kingdom in the other world, you must meet the original qualifications. You
need to have people whom you can lead on God's behalf. Also, you need to have your object partner
whom you can love on God's behalf. You need to perfect your husband-wife relationship on earth.<br />
When convex and concave finally become one, it means that heaven and earth become one. Man
symbolizes heaven; woman symbolizes earth. Whether you are a man or a woman, you must have your
own object partner in eternal love.<br />
Next, you must become God's image. You must become like God. Human beings and God have the same
attributes; therefore, be assured that each of you is a little god. Because the world of human beings is
eternal, when you go to your place of glory, we can say that you have returned.<br />
Using the word "return" to describe death is revelatory. It indicates that the purpose of one's life on earth
before shedding the physical form is to prepare for one's return to the other world. We need to become
God's object partners on the levels of the family, tribe, people and nation, and then live forever in the
infinite world as the embodiment of all glory. This is our ideal. (264-153, 1994/10/09)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The universe is the substantial entity whose appearance resembles God symbolically. Human beings
are substantial beings in God's image, while God is the Substantial Reality. Everything resembles the
Original Being. The beings who resemble Him the most are the ones in His image, human beings. Other
beings -- all things of creation-while resembling human beings, who are their subject partners, are
symbolic expressions of the Original Being.<br />
God, the world of beings who are in His image and the world of all things as symbolic expressions of God
are not separated from each other; they are actually one. Although I describe them using different words -- 
symbol, image and substance -- they have a common center. Since they have only one center, they
cannot help but dwell at that place of oneness. Each desires oneness with Him, whether they are entities
that resemble God in symbol, beings in His image, or the Substantial Being Himself.<br />
In this world, all things of the creation are beings in symbol, human beings are beings in God's image, and
God Himself is the Substantial Being. God is invisible and incorporeal. The ideal of creation is for the
incorporeal God to manifest as the corporeal God.<br />
God is already the substantial reality of the invisible world, but He also wants to be substantiated in the
visible world. This is the reason He created human beings; they are His substantial selves in the visible
world.<br />
The starting basis for human beings to become God's substantial selves is the True Parents. In the visible
world, the True Parents are the center of entities in symbol, the center of beings in image, and the central
focus of the Substantial Being. The central focus of the True Parents, who represent this visible world, is
to be united with the reality of God's invisible world.<br />
The same applies in the spirit world. In the spirit world as well, there is a world of beings in symbol, a
world of beings in image, and the world of the Substantial Reality. We cannot see such beings with our
physical eyes, but just as in the visible world, each consists of an inward nature and an outward form.
Nevertheless, the center of everything is the One. Whether it is in the visible world or the invisible world,
the center is the One. This invisible substantial center is where we will settle in the spirit world. (298-106,
1999/01/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the original Adam and Eve were growing, they could see God in each other with their spiritual
eyes. God manifested Himself through Adam and Eve, who were His embodiments. It was as if He were
sharing Himself with them. Although invisible, He would share everything of Himself with Adam and
Eve; in this way, God would come to them and manifest in their bodies.<br />
Although the mind is invisible, it does not mean that the mind does not know things. It does know. In
original human beings, the mind leads and guides everything in the position of subject partner. Adam and
Eve were not to live as their bodies wanted them to; they were to live in unity with God centering on their
minds.<br />
That is why we all have to absolutely center on the mind. The mind knows before our parents know,
before our teachers know, and even before God knows. Upholding the ideal of love, it wants to benefit us
a hundredfold, a thousand fold.<br />
Thus, had Adam and Eve reached perfection, they would have been able to feel God Himself. They would
have been unable to do anything against Him. They would have been able to feel His presence and know
Him. They would have been able to sense, "God and I are one!" (270-271, 1995/07/16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you go to the spiritual world, God will appear to you as True Parents. You will be able to see
God in them and through them, because He dwells in their hearts.<br />
God created human beings because He was in need of object partners. Unless you have an object partner,
you cannot feel love. Thus, God created human beings for the perfection of love; that is why He wanted
to assume substantial form. Further, He created them to multiply Himself. Without a substantial body that
can procreate on earth, it is impossible for God to multiply Himself. God created for these three reasons.<br />
God needs to assume bodily form, and in order to do so, He needs His object partners. It was Adam and
Eve whom God created as His object partners, in and through whom He was to assume substantial form.
Therefore, to see Adam and Eve would be to see God. (270-272, 1995/07/16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is the eternal, incorporeal, internal Parent of all humankind. Adam and Eve are the eternal,
corporeal, external parents of all humankind. When the incorporeal Parent as subject partner and the
corporeal parents as object partners give and receive eternal love and become totally one with each other,
they manifest supreme love and bear fruit. True love naturally manifests as unity, connects us to divine
life, and leads us to realize the ideal.<br />
God's most precious object partners are Adam and Eve. Centering on His love, they are to totally
harmonize and unite with God as parent and children, as subject partner and object partners, as the
incorporeal Creator and His corporeal embodiments in the substantial world. In this way, they are to
realize the ideals of eternal love and eternal life. This is God's Will.<br />
People up to now have generally asserted that created beings cannot stand in a position equal to the
Creator. However, if that were true, it would be impossible for the Creator to realize His ideal of love.
God's ideal of love is to relate to His children, Adam and Eve, as His corporeal substantial object partners
and attain oneness with them for eternity. God wants to dwell in human beings. The moment that those
human beings reach perfection as His object partners is the starting point for the incorporeal God to
realize His ideal of love through substantial human beings. (135-011, 1985/08/20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam and Eve, the horizontal True Parents, are the earthly king and queen. The heavenly king is God,
the vertical True Parent and King of love. When Adam and Eve make love as man and woman, the
Creator and the created beings who are to be the True Parents come together in a sacred union. That
loving union is the starting point for the manifestation of the horizontal king who can usher in the
kingdom of heaven on earth and the manifestation of the vertical king who rules over the kingdom of
heaven in heaven.<br />
Therefore, the focal point, the most precious things in the world, are the reproductive organs of man and
woman. They are the original palace. Only one person can own that palace -- only one man for the
woman's reproductive organ and only one woman for the man's. That palace is the palace of life and of
lineage. There can be only one king for that palace in the kingdom of heaven on earth and for that palace
in the kingdom of heaven in heaven.<br />
Hence, the wedding day of Adam and Eve is God's wedding day. When they enter into loving union, they
can finally perfect God and place Him in the position in which He is liberated. (253-213, 1994/01/23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first human beings were to inherit the seed of life, and represent God. God is the origin of the
seed of life. These human beings, who inherited God's seed, must then procreate. They are the True
Parents, the owners of the seed. From them, life is multiplied and expands horizontally in all directions.
This is the formula.<br />
Accordingly, the most blessed people are parents who give birth to many children. Parents with many
children can establish the foundation to receive many blessings. When their children manifest their value
as individuals, they are bound to inherit their family's foundation. When they marry, they will unite front
and rear, and right and left. This is the point of perfection; that is where God dwells. This is where the
perfection of children, the perfection of siblings, the perfection of husband and wife, and the perfection of
parents is realized. This is the point where everyone can connect to the invisible God.<br />
This family is everything that we human beings truly desire. This is the family that everyone seeks to
achieve. It is where God can fully manifest Himself in visible form. The love of brothers and sisters, the
love of husband and wife, and the love of parents and children are all included here. Such love is
something parents can bequeath to their children.<br />
When the invisible God began His creation, it was as if He were making an appearance in the visible
world. In creating human beings, God has four ideals: the ideal of parents, the ideal of husband and wife,
the ideal of brothers and sisters, and the ideal of sons and daughters. As God is the Parent of all
humankind, all parents have these same ideals. That is why parents want to give birth to children. As
children grow, they relate to their siblings. Later, they marry and become husbands or wives and look
forward to becoming parents. A husband and wife perfect their relationship when they are in total unity,
revolving around each other in all directions. At that point, another creation comes into being. The
invisible God, the Creator, is manifest in a husband and wife. This is how they can become an ideal
couple. God comes and shares their first wedding night with them. (248-109, 1993/08/01)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the original Adam and Eve marry, God, the incorporeal Parent who dwells in their external
forms, becomes the eternally existing Parent in the corporeal world. Then Adam and Eve become the
True Parents, the true ancestors of humankind. Thereupon, God becomes the Father with a form, and the
incorporeal and the corporeal become one. This symbolizes the oneness of heaven and earth. For this
reason, God created Adam and Eve in His own image and likeness. When Adam and Eve ascend to the
thrones of the palace in heaven, God will build His palace in their hearts. This is the kingdom of love.
(341-104, 2000/12/31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Adam and Eve had become God's embodiments, He would have dwelt within their hearts, reigning
over earth and heaven, the corporeal world and the incorporeal world. The sovereignty would have been
not only God's but also Adam and Eves. Hence, they would have expanded God's kingdom -- the
kingdom of peace -- on earth. Adam and Eve would have become the king and queen of the kingdom of
heaven on earth and also the king and queen of the kingdom of heaven in heaven. Inheriting all the
attributes of God, they would have become absolute and unique beings with dominion over all created
things. They would have become the substantial parents, the substantial king and queen, the substantial
owners, and the substantial teachers of eternal and unchanging true love. Had this happened, then today
all human beings would be God's second selves, the very embodiments of God. (501-033, 2005/07/14)</p>
