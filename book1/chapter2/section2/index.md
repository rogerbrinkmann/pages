## Chapter 2 The Holy Wedding of True Parents and the Era of True Parents 

### Section 2 The Lord and His Bride 

#### The Holy Wedding and True Mother 
Jesus came to earth to bring an end to the history that had resulted from the Fall of Adam and
Eve, and to restore the world of God's ideal of creation. But due to the disbelief of the chosen
people of Israel and the Jews of that time, he was unable to fulfill the Will. He ascended to
heaven, leaving behind the promise that he would come again. Following in Jesus' footsteps, True
Father took up the mission of the Messiah. He began his public ministry on August 15, 1945, the
day Korea regained its independence.
True Father tried to make unity with Christianity in the early days of his course. However, when
that course was frustrated due to Christians' disbelief, he had to lay the foundation for a new
providential church representing Christianity. For this, he endured great tribulations as he
walked the course of indemnity to restore the conditions for the Three Blessings. On May 1, 1954
in Seoul, he founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSAUWC). After that, he walked a seven-year course to restore through indemnity the entire New
Testament Age.
Since True Father had surmounted a total of 40 years of indemnity, counting from the time of his
birth, he succeeded in separating Satan from his course. Then, on April 11, 1960, he and True
Mother held their glorious Holy Wedding Ceremony. Thereby they became the first human
ancestors, husband and wife, in front of God.
1. Jesus died on the cross 2,000 years ago, unable to fully accomplish his mission. Today, 2,000 years
later, True Parents must fulfill what Jesus wanted to fulfill. Jesus wanted to fulfill it in his time based on
the Jewish people, but he could not. Now at this second attempt, we must substantiate the union of True
Father and True Mother centered on the worldwide foundation of Christianity. Without establishing this
foundational point, you cannot become true sons and true daughters of God's direct lineage. The ideal of
the Second Advent is to set the standard for humankind to be connected to God's lineage. The goal of the
Second Advent is also to have a true family, for it is with such a family that heaven's way can begin. With
it, true love and happiness can commence. (019-104, 1967/12/31)
2. When something is broken, bringing it back to its original condition requires that it be repaired. The
world wants to be made new. The nation, the society, the individual -- all want to be made new. People
want to be made new as God's sons and daughters. Jesus came as the new Son, so there had to be a new
Daughter. However, Jesus was killed before he could find this new Daughter. That one Mother was the
hope of the whole universe. Jesus' path to find her was full of hardship and persecution. His situation was
miserable. He was persecuted and chased from field to field and from town to town. Jesus tried to
accomplish God's Will by finding her through Joseph's family -- his own family from David's tribe, but he
could not. So he left his home and followed a course of public life for three years, still searching for her.
(019-161, 1968/01/01)
3. The fact that at present you cannot see God's face makes it seem as if you are still living in the womb.
Your situation is that you have yet to be born. This means you must be born again. Because the
providence of spiritual salvation already has been accomplished, people can be reborn spiritually.
However, this will not suffice. You need to be reborn in both spirit and flesh.
In the future, the Lord will return, but he will come as the True Parent. He will come to earth in the flesh
as the Father of humanity. He will come in the flesh as the Bridegroom, and from among the people, he
will find his Bride and establish her as the True Mother of humankind in the flesh. Then, finally, the
unfallen True Parents will emerge. Because Adam and Eve fell, the True Parents were lost. Hence, people
today are descended from the fallen parents, not the unfallen True Parents.
The Lord has returned in the flesh, in accordance with the providence of restoration, in order to complete
the mission of the True Parent. He comes with the truth about the history of the Human Fall. With this
truth, he must fully resolve this problem: when people have only the foundation of Jesus' spiritual
salvation, Jesus cannot give them birth as sons and daughters who can achieve perfection in both spirit
and flesh. (012-228, 1963/05/15)
4. Jesus came to earth as the Second Adam. The Holy Spirit, as the Second Eve, was unable to assume a
body. If you were to go to the spirit world, you would see that the Holy Spirit is the Mother Spirit of God.
When Jesus returns to earth in the flesh, the woman whom he takes as the Bride must meet the
qualifications, as stipulated by the Principle, to be the Bride. This requires that she knows all aspects of
the heavenly way. It requires that she looks forward to the Returning Lord's coming and prepares to
welcome him. These are the conditions she needs in order to prepare herself to establish the one Godcentered family, nation and world. This is her responsibility as the Bride. That is also why, as we entered
the 1960s, the women's movement began and is developing throughout the world.
No matter how many people there are on earth, they are all descendants of the Fall. They were all born
from the evil, fallen lineage. Therefore, a true woman must emerge who can love them as their True
Mother. As the Last Days draw near, the time is approaching when such a woman will appear. This is
why, to prepare the environment, women's movements are springing up worldwide.
We have now arrived at a time when many women can surpass men. The Last Days is the time when
women can restore the Fall, and these women in the realm of grace are able to come forward and
represent the heavenly Eve. Today it is not just a matter of women's liberation; women can stand in such a
position. Therefore, the True Mother must appear during this time. We must be able to attend this Mother
on earth. Humankind has been trying to return to God, and as we enter the era when this can happen, the
Bride must be established on earth. (016-182, 1966/03/22)
5. The Unification Church is the first parent-type religion. Religion began with the servant religion and
has progressed to the adopted-child religion, the stepchild religion, the son and daughter religion, and then
the mother religion.
God has been ever looking for the mother. God, the masculine subject partner, has had no partner. He
needs a female object partner. She is His partner, and at the same time she is the queen of earth. She is the
queen of the tribes and queen of the families. She stands as the grandmother of all ancestors, the mother
of all humankind, the wife of God and the daughter of God.
Mother is such a woman, with the value of the original True Mother. She is the queen of heaven, the
queen of earth, the queen of the nation, the grandmother to her ancestors, the mother of humankind, the
wife of God and the daughter of God. Mother's value is found in all of these roles. (398-134, 2002/12/09)
6. Have you ever heard people say that they believe in salvation through the family? If you ask Christians
who they believe in, they will answer, "I believe in Jesus." Buddhists, too, would say that they believe in
the Buddha, rather than in his family. However, in the future a religion to save the family needs to appear.
This is True Parents' teaching, which is the true parent religion. The true parent religion will enable you to
establish your own four-position foundation and live your life as true parents. Then you as the father and
mother become the saviors of your sons and daughters.
The Book of Revelation includes content concerning the work of restoration. This is one reason the Bible
is great. Because of the principle of restoration, the core content of restoration was placed at the end of
the Bible. Revelation 22:17 reads, "The Holy Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come.' And let everyone who
hears say, ‘Come.' And let everyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as
a gift." Do you know whom the Bride and the Holy Spirit refer to? The Bride refers to the Lord's wife.
The Holy Spirit is only a spiritual being. Therefore, the Mother with both spirit and flesh needs to appear.
Jesus, the Father of humankind, is a man, so the Mother of humankind must be found among women.
When she is found, together they will save all humankind by guiding them to a new world. (021-050,
1968/09/01)
7. Mother, this woman whom I have married, is truly great. Her greatness does not come from a beautiful
face but from a beautiful heart. Even her beautiful voice and her graceful manner are because of her
beautiful heart. I am a teacher who teaches God's philosophy by actually living it. Because I am living
according to the Principle, I praise Mother and promote her in front of the public on God's behalf. This is
in accordance with the Principle. (229-224, 1992/04/12)
8. People throughout the world say that my wife is beautiful. I spent some time thinking about what
makes a person truly beautiful. A beautiful woman is not someone who has a beautiful face. To be a truly
beautiful woman, she must be beautiful in heart. The beauty of such a woman will not diminish even after
1,000 years. Even after all that time, she will possess a refined and harmonious appearance. Such a
woman can embrace her surroundings and bring out the best in any situation. Such a woman is the beauty
of all beauties. Mother has that kind of beauty. That is why I think she is the beauty among beauties.
(220-175, 1991/10/19)
9. Mother is a woman of great wisdom. Also, her eyes are magnificent. When she smiles, I am completely
mesmerized by her charming eyes. She has such beautiful eyes. I really like Mother's nose too. When she
senses something good is coming, she laughs in such a way that her nostrils start to flutter. I am not sure
if this is Mother's charm, but I tell you that, as her husband, it moves my heart. Also, if we encounter a
grave or serious situation, Mother tries not to purse her lips to show that she is upset. When I see her
wisely restraining herself like that, I find her lips even more beautiful. Mother also has a lovely demeanor.
Indeed, she has many great qualities. I think wives who possess these graces carry the secret keys to solve
all problems and make all things go well. (127-093, 1983/05/05)
10. One of Mother's special qualities is that she is intuitive. This is an inborn quality. Further, whenever I
ask her to do something, she makes a firm resolution to fulfill it. Then she never forgets that resolution
until it is done. That is why she has been able to overcome every trial on her path. She has perseverance
and patience for God's purpose. Another reason I am very grateful to Mother is that she is very giving.
She always wants to give away her most precious possessions, not only to our own children, but also to
all of you, at any time and without hesitation. I believe that this trait of her personality is a God-given gift.
(092-329, 1977/05/03)
11. Mother needed to give birth to at least 12 children within a span of 20 years in order to completely
restore Jacob's family through paying indemnity. Jesus' 12 disciples could not unite with each other.
What did they do? They abandoned Jesus, and one of them ended up selling him. Why did this happen?
One problem was that despite their brotherly ties, the disciples were from different tribes. There was a
problem in Jacob's family because he had sons and daughters born from four different women. In my
time, in order to overcome that problem Mother gave birth to at least 12 children within a 20-year time
period. Had she not succeeded in this, she could not have fulfilled her mission as True Mother.
From this point of view, you can see that no one more than 20 years old could have fulfilled the position
of True Mother. She had to be at most 18 or 19 years old. That is why at the age of 40 I married Mother
who was just 17 years old. Just as I embarked on the path for the Will at the age of 16, a woman had to
meet that standard at around the same age. Otherwise, she would have no way to bring about the
liberation of women. (247-255, 1993/05/09)
12. Throughout history there was no woman who was willing to suffer through all kinds of miserable
situations and still support her husband through even more difficulties, continually and without complaint.
If there were a woman who suffered through such hardships and then said, "Standing before the Will, I
have nothing but gratitude," that woman would be able to comfort us when we felt discouraged.
Such is the case with True Mother. At the point at which she started her life with me, she had to pay
incredible indemnity in heart. She had to avoid having any condition to be accused, whether from above
or from below. It didn't matter that she was younger than 20 years old; if God permitted His object partner
to be someone of that age, that young woman had to be able to adapt to whatever difficult situation she
might face.
That is why it was good that I found Mother among those who came from a solitary family background.
Mother came from a simple family. She had no father or older brother. She had only one person with her:
her mother, Grandmother Hong, a woman who was willing to do anything for heaven. (121-212,
1982/10/27)
13. Mother was 17 years old at the time of the Holy Wedding. I was 40 years old. As a fully grown man,
I received a young lady of 17 years as my wife and placed her in the position of True Mother. This was
unacceptable in the eyes of the world, but I had to do it for the sake of the providence. There was no other
way.
Ever since I received her as Mother, I have been leading the providence with her. So when we were
engaged, I explained everything about the path I had to follow, saying, "This is the way I must go."
Mother respects me because whatever I do is in accordance with the providential program. I also gave her
basic guidelines, saying, "If you are attacked in this way, you need to overcome it like this. If you are
attacked in that way, you must do things that way." Mother respects me because I do what I say I will do.
Even though the path is difficult, I overcome each obstacle and move forward. (236-109, 1992/11/03)
14. A month before the Holy Wedding, Father appeared to me in a dream and gave me a special
revelation from God, "Be prepared, for that day is at hand." More than a marriage proposal, it was a
decree from heaven. When I received that decree, I was completely overwhelmed. Because at the time I
did not have the ability to deal with such a monumental matter, I had to empty myself. All I could do was
pray. I responded while constantly keeping that revelation in mind, thinking, "O God, I have been living
in accordance with Your Will. I will follow and do whatever Your Will may be. Whatever Your
providential purpose for me may be, I will follow as You command." I was 17 years old, and it was
sometime in February. I did not want to analyze the situation at that time because I was making internal
preparations by emptying myself. I only wanted to follow God's Will. (True Mother, 1977/05/03)
15. I know of a story from the line of my mother's family that seems like a legend. In the Jo clan of my
maternal grandmother, Jo Won-mo, there is a record about a Maitreya statue from the time of our ancestor
Jo Han-Jun. In 1991, when I went with Father to North Korea, I inquired whether this statue of the
Maitreya actually existed. I was told that it still exists to this day. According to this story, Jo Han-jun had
a dream in which the Maitreya Buddha promised him that a princess from heaven would be sent to his
descendants.
I was born into that loyal family in remembrance of this ancestor's devotion to the nation. My
grandmother was born into that lineage, and my mother, Daemonim, was born from her. Thus, heaven
began to work from the time of Jo Han-jun in order to prepare the environment in which I would meet the
Messiah at his Second Coming and be raised up as his partner.
From this, we can learn a lesson: Heaven will absolutely remember whatever conditions we make. This is
why when I met Father I already understood what would be essential to my mission. Since I was born and
grew up in the environment that God had prepared, I knew what I had to do and the mission I needed to
accomplish. 

#### The Holy Wedding of the True Parents
After True Father traveled the path of blood, sweat and tears to indemnify Jesus' course, he was
engaged to True Mother. She was the only daughter of Mrs. Hong Soon-ae (Daemonim), who was
devoting her entire life with complete dedication to serve and attend the Lord at his Second
Advent. The engagement took place at the original Cheongpa-dong headquarters church in Seoul,
at 4:00 in the morning on March 27, 1960 (1st day of the 3rd lunar month). Four days later, on
March 31, Father officially decided to hold the Holy Wedding of the True Parents and the
Blessing of three of their main disciples.
On April 11, 1960 (16th day of the 3rd lunar month), at 10:00 a.m. at the former headquarters
church in Seoul, the historic Holy Wedding of the True Parents was held. More than 700
members were in attendance, invited from every church in Korea. There were two ceremonies:
The first was the Ceremony to Restore the Parents through Indemnity, and the second, held
immediately following the first, was the Ceremony for the Parents of Glory. (True Mother,
2012/12/25)
16. Mother and I were blessed in marriage in 1960, 14 years after the liberation of Korea. Why did it take
14 years? The ancestors of humankind fell at the completion level of the growth stage. Thus, based on the
principle of restoration through indemnity, it took a period of 14 years filled with persecution for me to
take root in Korea and build an altar named the Unification Church. All of this was to place True Mother
in her position. I had to do it even as we fought against the opposition of Christianity and the Republic of
Korea.
With the establishment of True Mother, God could finally settle on earth. To achieve this, I set conditions
to indemnify and resolve the problems in providential history that occurred in the times of Adam, Noah,
Abraham and thereafter. Although the Christian cultural sphere took over and dealt with all these issues,
including establishing a nation and a people representing Israel that was prepared to receive me, when
Christianity turned against me, it was as if the spiritual foundation that it had restored through paying
indemnity for 2,000 years crumbled.
Therefore, when I found Mother 14 years after God called me, I was providentially in the same situation
as when Jesus died on the cross. In other words, the Republic of Korea stood in the same position as
Israel at the time of Jesus. Likewise, Christianity was in the same position as Judaism, and I and the
Unification Church were in the same position as Jesus and the early Christian church. Since Jesus carried
the cross on account of persecution by the nation of Israel and Judaism, we had to battle through the same
situation and win. We had to restore everything through paying indemnity. (143-178, 1986/03/18)
17. I had to fight up to the last minute. The day before going to the wedding venue, I had to go to the
police station and write an affidavit. Numerous betrayers made accusations against me. Just as Jesus' 12
disciples betrayed him, 12 previously faithful church members banded together against me. Individuals
who had been on the side of the Unification Church began to oppose me, other churches opposed me, and
the nation opposed me. Just as the nation of Israel, the leaders of Judaism, and Judas Iscariot banded
together and killed Jesus, I was being driven toward a similar fate.
The date of the Holy Wedding was the 16th day of the 3rd lunar month in 1960. That time marked the
highest peak of opposition. I stood on the dividing line between moving one step forward or one step
back, between life and death, between making a new start and not making one. In those circumstances, I
managed to bring a new historic result.
On that day, God made the greatest proclamation in human history, the proclamation that will spread
heavenly fortune to the world. It was the historic day that Jesus spoke about -- the day of welcoming the
Bride. It was the day of True Parents' Holy Wedding. From that moment on, I could go on the offensive
and take the first steps forward. Finally, I could begin resolving the problems we faced and move swiftly
forward centered on God. (067-250, 1973/07/01)
18. On the path of restoration through paying indemnity, we must follow a law or formula -- that of
making certain required conditions. Around the time the Holy Wedding was going to take place, some
Unification Church members left the church. Twelve persons who had once been members of the church
banded together and started opposing me, just as Jesus' 12 disciples opposed him. It was inevitable that I
go through the same in the restoration process. The nation opposed me, trying to knock me down.
Christianity opposed me, and members who had left the Unification Church opposed me. Those three
groups united in a fight to destroy me. From Satan's standpoint, the nation represented the formation
stage, Christianity represented the growth stage, and the members who had left the church represented the
completion stage. This is why Satan worked through them to attack me. (086-238, 1976/04/01)
19. For seven years, beginning in 1953, I prepared for the Holy Wedding. Around that time virtually
everyone opposed me: the nation, Christianity, and even some members. In 1955 I was incarcerated, but
even in prison I fought to lay the foundation for victory. Then in 1957 I began preparing for the Blessing
in earnest. I fasted for 40 days and exhorted the members to evangelize in order to lay a nationwide
foundation. I went on the offensive and expanded our evangelizing activities throughout the nation. I
raised the Unification Church to a new level.
In this way, by 1960 I had laid a nationwide foundation and made an impact on the nation. So, although I
was opposed by the nation and by Christianity on the national level, I could proceed with the Holy
Wedding. I had to conduct the Holy Wedding in circumstances similar to those of Jesus when he was
arrested and made to go the way of the cross. Indeed, at the time of the Holy Wedding, the nation opposed
me and Christianity opposed me. They were united against me. (111-199, 1981/02/20)
20. The Holy Wedding took place 15 days after the Engagement Ceremony. It began with the Ceremony
to Restore the Parents through Indemnity. It was followed by the Ceremony for the Parents of Glory.
For the first ceremony, 12 attendants stood on each side of the aisle. I wore white traditional Korean
attire (chima-jeogori) and a long wedding veil. Father and I descended the stairs from the second floor
together amid the echoing sounds of the choir singing "Song of the Banquet." We then took our places at
the front of the room. Following True Father's prayer and proclamation, representative members offered a
congratulatory address and recited a poem of praise.
Soon, the second ceremony commenced. Father and I were dressed in traditional Korean wedding attire
(samo-gwandae for the groom; hwal-ot for the bride) and headdresses. Father offered a pledge to God,
and all members bowed four times to God and True Parents. We bowed three times facing each other.
Then we exchanged gifts and offered a final bow to each other. Representative members presented a gift
and read a congratulatory address. True Father offered a second pledge to God, and the historic event
concluded with Father raising his hands to offer a benediction upon everyone present. (True Mother,
2013/11/30)
21. Seven hundred members from around Korea were invited to attend the Holy Wedding. Father
distributed tickets stamped with his seal to everyone who attended. He told them, "In the future, with this
ticket even a person who is supposed to go to hell can enter heaven." I believe those words were meant to
emphasize the preciousness of True Parents' Holy Wedding, and that Father wanted the people who were
there to treasure the value of that moment.
The ceremonial table for the Holy Wedding had been prepared according to instructions revealed by
heaven. It was a large table with 40 different kinds of food. Father and I ate together and the wedding
festivities took place.
We changed out of our wedding attire and put on Korean traditional clothes. I danced merrily with Father.
After Father sang, he requested a song from me. He then chose some members to sing, and we all sang
together.
The Holy Wedding was the ceremony that inaugurated the True Parents of humankind for the first time in
human history, but it was held in a humble setting. Considering the providential value and significance of
the occasion, all people of the world should have celebrated it, offering their congratulations and praising
God. (True Mother, 2013/11/30)
22. O Heaven, may you lift up the flag of victory! O Earth, may you offer the gift of joy in front of
Heavenly Father! Heavenly Father, I know that on this occasion heaven and earth are together in oneness
offering glory, glory, and infinite glory to You. May all future generations keep and cherish this
auspicious occasion. Father, let the drums roll, and let us march forward on and on into Satan's world to
quickly bring back all of Your children to You as brave people who are restored. I sincerely hope and
pray that You will enable us to become children who can pledge and vow to commit ourselves with all of
our hearts, and even our blood and flesh. Please welcome this daughter who was anointed here today, and
guide her to become Your daughter who can sever all bitter sorrow and pain, by enabling her to wear the
olive laurel wreath of victory. (150-113, 1960/03/27)
23. I can never describe the heart of God, who has been preparing everything for this day, the day of the
Holy Wedding. I am so overwhelmed by our Heavenly Fathers love, having sent me as His daughter to
this place so that we can fulfill the Will and conclude 6,000 years of providential history. I just do not
know what to say. Until the day when we have fulfilled the Will, I pledge that I will advance with you
members in oneness of heart and in all aspects of life. (True Mother, 1960/04/11)
