## Chapter 2 The Holy Wedding of True Parents and the Era of True Parents 

### Section 4 True Parents' Completion of the Providence

#### The proclamation of True Parents 
After the Holy Wedding and the subsequent seven-year course, True Parents formed the True
Family and established the four-position foundation on the family level. On that foundation, they
went through the eight stages to complete their mission, thus creating the foundation to establish
and build the kingdom of heaven. As the providence of restoration progressed, they set indemnity
conditions appropriate to each period of time and accomplished them. After each one, they
conducted a corresponding proclamation ceremony so that Satan could not invade it.
After True Parents had thus prevailed in the history of the providence of restoration through
indemnity, by 1992 the foundation of the True Family was such that they finally could proclaim
before the public that they were the True Parents of humankind. On August 24, 1992, at the
celebration banquet of the 1st World Culture and Sports Festival, True Father officially declared
in front of the assembled world leaders, "At the Women's Federation for World Peace Leaders'
Assemblies that were held in five major cities of Korea in early July of this year, I proclaimed
that my wife, Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon, and I together are the True Parents of humanity, the Savior,
the Lord of the Second Advent and the Messiah."
By holding marriage Blessings, True Parents have been carrying out the great revolutionary
work of changing the lineage of all people to the true lineage of God. These Blessings have been
interracial, interreligious and international in scope. True Parents come with the true love, life
and lineage of heaven. They alone are aware of the providential timetable for holding these
events, and they are completing the providence of human salvation in accordance with that
timetable.
1. Christianity opposed me after World War II; hence, during the following 40 years I had to completely
restore through indemnity what John the Baptist failed to do. I had to restore the failure of Christianity;
otherwise, I would have had no way to find and install the Bride. So, by paying indemnity for more than
40 years, I completely restored the failure of John the Baptist and the Christian cultural sphere. This work
was to restore America and reclaim it from Satan. That is why True Mother went to the United States
Congress and proclaimed "True Parents and the Completed Testament Age." She did the same at the
United Nations.
The United Nations originally was meant to represent the free world, which had lost the foundation to
receive the Bride. Mother is the Bride. Hence, when she proclaimed True Parents throughout America and
at the United Nations, America and the free world had to unite with her. Fortunately, there was no
opposition. Although she made that bold proclamation about True Parents and the Completed Testament
Age, all audiences were moved to applaud her. (249-109, 1993/10/08)
2. The Fall of the first human ancestors caused the loss of the four great realms of heart and the three
great kingships. Now, finally we are liberated to lift up the name of True Parents. We reached that
position 47 years after World War II, after indemnifying all the failures of history. The lonely path of the
heart that Mother followed her whole life was entirely to prepare for this one day, when she would fulfill
the mission she was destined for.
In April 1992, Mother took the first step when, as chairwoman of the Women's Federation for World
Peace, she proclaimed to the world that the True Parents had come to earth to embrace all the families of
humankind and bring liberation to the women of the world. Then in July 1992, she proclaimed that the
True Parents had come, and that she and I are the Messiah, the Savior, the Returning Lord and the True
Parents of humankind. By making these proclamations, Mother prepared a zone for providential
settlement in which to build the one axis in a world that lacks a center and whose families lack a
framework that gives them hope; all this was done at a time when the international situation was chaotic.
Because she made these conditions in a manner that was acceptable to God, the era when we could
proclaim the liberation of Mother and the second generation was ushered in. (241-249, 1992/12/26)
3. Korea is the land to which the Lord is to return. The Lord at the Second Advent whom Christians have
been expecting is none other than I. Today, July 3, 1992 is the first time I am announcing this in public.
For the first time, I am putting it in writing, in order to let the world know who the Lord at the Second
Advent is. What did I write? Sun Myung Moon! I wrote this for the first time. Now that I have made this
official announcement, you need to clearly understand what it means. From now on, everything will be
revealed. (232-109, 1992/07/03)
4. In August 1992, during the World Culture and Sports Festival at the Little Angels' Performing Arts
Center, in front of the approximately 1,000 prominent leaders from around the world, including heads of
state who were participating in the eight events of the festival, I proclaimed, "I am the Messiah, the Savior
and the True Parent." Even so, they nodded their heads; no one shook their heads in objection.
I am traveling all over the world. Don't you think I know what to say about the current political scene? In
fact, no one has deeper insight or a better brain for dealing with this transitional era than I do. The world
recognizes this about me. That is why I must let the world know what is happening. Unless I proclaim
who I am in public, I cannot take root in the world.
It is only after their wedding that people can be officially recognized as husband and wife. Accordingly, I
traveled throughout the nation and held banquets where I made proclamations about who we are. This
was so that True Parents can settle; then heaven and earth can also settle. To found a nation, it is not
enough just to select the members of the cabinet. The founder must proclaim himself to the public. That is
why I proclaimed that we are the Messiah, the Lord at the Second Advent and the True Parents.
Henceforth, we will build our foundation. (243-168, 1993/01/03)
5. Centering on God, I proclaimed that we are the True Parents of humankind. I proclaimed worldwide
that the unfallen True Parents who can liberate humankind have come to this world. Now that True
Parents have emerged, their children also can become true parents; and all those who receive their
teachings likewise can become true parents. Due to the Fall, the term "true parents" vanished and the
persons who could have become true parents disappeared. (322-250, 2000/05/21)
6. My encounter with Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union was equivalent to Jacob's encounter with
Esau in the Old Testament Age. I represented the United States, Japan and Korea in the position of Jacob,
and Gorbachev represented the Soviet Union, China and North Korea. We met, and I planted God's true
love in his heart. This meant Jacobs return to his hometown. Now the only remaining thing for Esau to do
is to unite with his younger brother and attend the Heavenly Parent. He needs to bring his communist
nations to unite with the younger brother nations of the free world and attend the Heavenly Parent; it is
the only way for the communist world to survive.
This was an event without precedent since the beginning of history. It was a new beginning to bring
victory for heaven's side. For this reason, now that I have returned to Korea, I am holding this Rally
Welcoming True Parents, to proclaim True Parents to the people of the Republic of Korea. (204-144,
1990/07/06)
7. Now that True Parents have been proclaimed to the world, the cosmos is approaching a turning point.
For the cosmos to follow True Parents, it must have true children, true clans and true peoples. Now that
you have been proclaiming True Parents throughout the world, it is time for you, as their true children, to
proclaim the true family. Your proclamations should not be limited to the family level. Since the First
Adam and the Second Adam were not able to complete their missions, to indemnify this you need to
expand the realm of tribal messiahship. Therefore, all of you need to conduct events to proclaim True
Parents while taking the position of true parents to your tribes. That is how you can build the foundation
to bring change on the national level and the world level. (202-178, 1990/05/20)
8. Jesus strove to fulfill the work that Adam failed to do, but he was not able to complete it. Since Jesus
passed away before he could do this, the Lord of the Second Advent, who comes as the perfected Third
Adam, is required to rectify the failures that occurred at the time of the First Adam and Second Adam and
complete their unfinished work.
Originally, all humankind should have been the descendants of the First Adam. Even though the First
Adam failed, had Jesus not died on the cross, this world would have been filled with Jesus' sons and
daughters. The world would have become one world by now. Had Jesus not died but married and given
birth to sons and daughters, the members of his clan, in the position of the elder son, would have inherited
the kingship on this earth for tens of thousands of years.
Democracy is a siblings' ideology. It is not Parentism. Siblings compete and fight to get what they want.
They fight because they have no parents to be centered on. That is why humankind must turn to
Parentism. True Parents need to come in order to solve the problems throughout the world that came into
existence due to the siblings' ideology. (224-054, 1991/11/21)
9. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve fell in their teenage years. The Fall was a problem of love
between a man and woman. Since that is the seed that was sown, now that the harvest time has arrived
worldwide, the problems of promiscuity among young people and family breakdown have become
serious.
All humankind is bewailing this reality, yet no real owner has stepped up to take responsibility for it.
Therefore, True Parents, the original owners of creation, must come. When they do, everything that was
defiled by the false parents can be resolved. In the Last Days, all these problems will face judgment.
Individuals, families, peoples, nations, the world and the cosmos on God's side will establish a new
viewpoint centering on True Parents. Then we will undoubtedly recover the world where everything in
heaven and on earth is united as one. For this to happen, True Parents must emerge and bring true love,
true life and true lineage. (362-158, 2001/12/12)
10. The Messiah is the True Father. Because the Fall occurred, the false parents emerged and all human
beings have been born from their false lineage; therefore, the providence of salvation is not an easy task
to fulfill. No matter how many times the blood of the false lineage is purified, it cannot be purified
completely. That is why the salvation of human beings remains incomplete even after tens of millions of
years.
God cannot undo what was defiled by the false parents. The ideal of creation is that human beings
complete their portion of responsibility, inherit God's lineage and bequeath it to their descendants. Adam
and Eve destroyed the ideal of creation. Therefore, Adam and Eve must restore it. No one else can rectify
it; not even God. That is why True Parents must come and restore it through indemnity.
What went wrong must be turned around to the original state. This is called restoration through
indemnity. Restoration cannot be done by following a natural course. It must be done by taking the
reverse course in order to return to the original state. Without going through such a course of restoration
through indemnity, there is no way for human beings to return to the original world. Not for eternity.
(334-035, 2000/09/27)
11. You do not understand the difficult circumstances I have faced until now. Ninety-nine out of 100
people would have given up and run away. That is how fearful and serious my position was. However, I
did not budge even one inch. This is because I regarded it as my destiny. Had the path been easy, I am
sure that Satan would have taken it first. I went on a path that even Satan did not dare to go. This is how I
have expanded my scope from the family to the tribe, people, nation, world and cosmos.
As a true man, I am positioned as the mediator between God and human beings in a world disconnected
from God. I am to bring God back to them by building God a highway. On it, God will descend from the
level of the cosmos to the world, to nations, peoples, tribes and families. The place where God descends
and dwells is the realm of the True Parents. Now I have established a realm that Satan cannot invade.
(248-037, 1993/05/30)
12. I was not born as a prince of a fabulous kingdom. No one recognized who I was. Few ever imagined
that the Lord would return to Korea, a small nation scarred from numerous wars. The Lord of the Second
Advent comes at a time when the four realms that emerged as a result of Jesus' death on the cross-
democracy and communism, and Islam and Christianity -- are enemies to each other. Their conflicts
having reached the world level, the Lord has to deal with them and bring them into unity.
Indeed, this is what I have done. I have finished my part. In order to come this far, I had to deal with
many complex situations behind the scenes. They were incomparably more difficult than what a typical
family has to deal with. They were incomparably more difficult than even the ordeals that nations have to
deal with. Nevertheless, I worked patiently to deal with them and overcame every challenge I faced along
the way. (249-085, 1993/10/08)
13. When the Lord comes again, he needs to unite the world that is now divided between the left wing and
the right wing. He also must unite the religions of the world. That is why I have been forging unity
between the left wing and the right wing, and among religions. Neither the United States government nor
the government of the Soviet Union is doing this. The Lord to come needs to fulfill what Jesus was not
able to fulfill in his lifetime. Otherwise, he cannot turn the world around.
Human history does not proceed randomly; it proceeds hand in hand with God's providence. Since my
coming, the providence and history have advanced side by side. I can testify that God is alive and
working in human history. We are now living in a time when we cannot deny the existence of God. (235-
212, 1992/09/20)
14. Blessed families are in the position of Jesus, and they must restore the nation as Jesus was supposed to
do. Israel was divided between the north and the south. It was divided between the northern kingdom,
composed of ten tribes, and the southern kingdom, with two tribes. Leah and Rachel should have united;
because they were unable to resolve their struggle, the nation was divided into two. Jesus died under
similar circumstances, symbolized by the thief on the left and the thief on the right. The two thieves
represented Cain and Abel on the world level. Thus, when the Lord returns, he needs to change the
situation and bring them into unity. That is how he can establish the realm of victory.
That is why, as the person with the mission of the Lord of the Second Advent, I must gain victory over
communism. I had no choice but to become the premier world champion in the fight against communism
and bring about its defeat. Furthermore, I must bring unity to democracy and bring unity to the world,
even by guiding the United States of America. Also, I must unite the worlds of religion and politics. (250-
331, 1993/10/15)
15. True Parents are responsible to connect the realms of indirect dominion and direct dominion. The
question is how to tear down the walls that Satan has erected around individuals, families, tribes, peoples,
nations and the world. God has been working continually to achieve this goal, while Satan has been
challenging God and striving to block God's work. In this way, God and Satan have been confronting
each other.
Satan persists in confronting God. So, standing between God and Satan, I have been working to remove
Satan. I have to advance the providence to the position where Satan cannot accuse me. That is why I had
to go the path of indemnity, which is the human portion of responsibility. The first human beings failed to
fulfill their portion of responsibility. Satan understands that their portion became the responsibility of the
Messiah. That is why he mobilized all his forces to attack True Parents. All the difficulties we face have
come about because we are breaking down his walls around individuals, families, tribes, peoples, nations,
the world and the spirit world. (131-070, 1984/04/16)
16. People who did good deeds through their devotion to and faith in the major world religions and then
went to the spirit world as good spirits have helped the earthly providence according to God's desire.
Until the present time, the only way they could connect to the earth was through religion. However, now
True Parents have come to earth. They have fought and triumphed over evil, and they have established
God's tradition from the level of the individual to the family, tribe, nation and world. As a result, we are
entering the time of the emancipation of the religious realm.
Now that the scope of True Parents' victory has reached the world level, in the age inaugurated by the
True Parents, religion will disappear. If Adam and Eve had not fallen but become the True Parents of
humankind, religion would not have been necessary. If they had fulfilled their responsibility from the
beginning, they would have united with heaven as one body. Then, their ideal oneness would have been
the basis for all ancestors in heaven to connect with their descendants living on earth whenever they were
needed.
I have done everything necessary to restore through indemnity the realm of the people of Israel as a
chosen people, the realm of worldwide Christianity as a chosen people, and the realm of the cosmic
Unification Church as a chosen people. With that, the age is coming when religion will be liberated from
its responsibility. Then the spirit world and the earthly world will connect directly.
Therefore, even those without religious belief can be connected to the spirit world through the realm of
the chosen people, which passes through religion. The old era is coming to an end. Thanks to True
Parents' victory, even people who do not believe in religion will be able to grow through the Old
Testament Age, New Testament Age and Completed Testament Age, just as people do who are situated
within the realms of the major religions. Hence, the time will come when all their ancestors will come
down from the spirit world to visit their descendants and support them. (202-255, 1990/05/24) 

#### Proclamations of True Parents' ultimate unity
In 2010, on the 8th day of the 5th month by the heavenly calendar (June 19) at 2:20 a.m. and the
15th day of the 5th month by the heavenly calendar (June 26) at 3:25 a.m., True Parents
proclaimed in Las Vegas that they had achieved oneness in mind, oneness in body, oneness in
thought and oneness in core with God, vertically, and that they had achieved ultimate unity
horizontally. On that foundation, they declared the completion, conclusion and closure of the Old
Testament, New Testament and Completed Testament Ages, and the advent of the age in which
God is all-immanent, all-transcendent, all-powerful and all-capable.
Then, on the 17th day of the 11th month by the heavenly calendar (December 11) in 2011, True
Father announced at Cheon Jeong Gung Palace, "Now that all beings in heaven and on earth are
aligned with God the Creators original standard of creation that has now been restored, I
declare the completion, conclusion and closure of the entire providence and the final victory."
Then he proclaimed, "All is finished!"
On the 17th and 18th days of the 11th month by the heavenly calendar (December 11 and 12) in
2011 at the Ocean Cheon Jeong Gung Palace, True Parents wrote the Proclamation of the Final
Cheon Il Guk Victory, "God and True Parents are completely one. God is complete, perfected
and fulfilled. Aju! Heaven is here. Congratulations! Sun Myung Moon. Aju!"
Finally, on the 26th day of the 6th month by the heavenly calendar (August 13) in 2012, 21 days
before his Holy Ascension on the 17th day of the 7th month (September 3), True Father, during
his report prayer to our Heavenly Parent made the final official proclamation of his earthly life,
with the following words, "Today, as I have returned the conclusion of the final perfection to You,
Father, I know that up to this moment, I have offered my whole life to You. I am spending this
time now to bring my life to its conclusion, to bring it to a close with utmost devotion, in
accordance with Your Will. May the tribal messiahs be able to fulfill the calling of national
representatives. I have accomplished everything for this. I have completed everything. Aju!"
17. Now I am establishing the tradition that no one can match, either mentally or physically. With my
mind fixed on heaven and earth, I am making countless conditions of devotion. When my conditions are
so sincere that they touch both heaven and earth, Satan cannot invade what I am doing. It is mainly those
conditions of devotion that prevent Satan from invading. My conditions enable family members in heaven
and all the spirit persons in heaven to build a bridge to earth, and when those in the spirit world come
down on that bridge and connect to my foundation, Satan cannot oppose them. This means that I have
now laid all the foundations needed to fulfill the Will. (285-303, 1997/06/29)
18. Thus far, everyone opposed the path I was taking. America opposed me, the Soviet Union opposed
me, China opposed me, Kim Il-sung opposed me, and all others opposed me. Yet I have overcome them
all. My mission is to defeat the left-wing communists and completely liberate the people in the
communist world. I am working to unite all the people in Satan's realm and bind all humankind together,
based on one standard.
Now there are no barriers for those on this path. There had been all sorts of barriers, but I tore them all
down. I now have gone through all eight levels, from the individual to God, so that I can make the
environment free of barriers. The unity that I am referring to is unity of the individual, unity of the family,
unity of the tribe, unity of the people, unity of the nation, unity of the world, and unity of heaven and
earth. By tearing down the walls of Satan's world and forming an environment of unity, I am trying to
recover the original fatherland. (241-325, 1993/01/01)
19. I have to represent 4,000 years of history; that is why I have not been able to sleep comfortably for the
past 40 years. I have faced opposition from all people and all nations. During that time, I struggled
desperately to find out how to overcome that opposition on the levels of the individual, family, tribe,
nation, world and cosmos. To overcome those obstacles, I had to take a path completely different from the
paths in Satan's world. While communicating with God, who was with me behind the scenes wherever I
went in heaven and on earth, I tore down the walls of Satan's world one by one. By breaking down all the
walls, I built a highway from the individual level to the levels of the family, tribe, people, nation, world
and all of heaven and earth. These efforts restored human beings to the positions of Adam and Eve before
they fell.
Now God can be with us wherever we go. I recovered this position for humankind. Heaven's world is
advancing, and Satan's world is retreating. Satan cannot interfere with God's world any longer. Whenever
heaven advances, Satan has no choice but to surrender. (244-208, 1993/02/07)
20. I broke down all the walls in front of me -- eight levels of walls from the individual and family to the
nation and beyond. Over the past 40 years, I have prepared the path for Adam and Eve to return, so they
can move back and forth. Now that path is complete. It is a path that will remain even after I have
returned to God.
Numerous religions and nations opposed me, but I did not oppose them. Yet I did not die; I am still alive.
Now I have finished everything. Therefore, even if I die now, it doesn't matter. This is because the truth I
have brought will continue to exist. The Principle will remain; it is the teaching that was declared
victorious at the trial in God's court. Even Satan cannot deny it. (235-248, 1992/09/20)
21. Adam should complete restoration in his own generation. Since all the issues of restoration must be
resolved within True Parents' generation, you have no idea how busy we are.
That is why we conduct proclamation ceremonies. Through these ceremonies, we plant flags to make God
the owner. Once we plant a flag, God and True Parents have the authority of dominion over that territory;
it no longer belongs to Satan's domain. That is why, when we returned to Korea after traveling to Russia
and America, we made proclamations throughout the nation. By so doing, we drove in posts, to signify
that we prepared an environment in which the people of Korea would not oppose us but would welcome
us. After we did this, Satan had to retreat.
If people believe these proclamations and come into the realm of these proclamations, then Satan cannot
take them away. It is as if a person who formerly lived without a nationality joins a nation with a newly
drawn national boundary and lives in accordance with the laws of that new environment; then he or she
can belong to its people. (329-267, 2000/08/11)
22. A problem would arise in the spirit world as well as on earth if I did not disclose that I am the one
who comes into the world with God's Divine Seal as the True Parent, the Savior, the Messiah and the king
of peace, the one long sought by humanity. That is why I made the proclamation as to who I am. That
proclamation can be likened to proclaiming a constitution that has already been ratified. Those who are
not in accord with it will fall behind, and those who are in accord with it will move forward and remain
forever.
I have become the standard for perfection on all levels; my position is above the constitution, just as the
constitution is above all other laws. Therefore, I must disclose everything, without hiding anything. I have
not done it yet, but by the time I leave earth, I should be able to say, "I have finished everything." I should
be able to say that everything I did and all that I connected with in my surroundings had a reason and a
purpose for the fulfillment of the Will.
Then, when I go to the spirit world, I should be able to begin taking firm root there. Earth also will unite
in partnership with the spirit world, and together they will form the kingdom of peace. What I am saying
is serious. I have come this far, pouring out my utmost devotion, in order to transcend the realm of life
and death, and to remove death once and for all. I am proclaiming this now for your sake. (504-203,
2005/08/16)
23. God is invisible, yet I must be able to attend Him as the True Parent even better than I would attend
anyone visible to my physical eyes. I have a responsibility to follow the way of light amid the light, to
remove the darkness, and to reach the position where I can liberate all people from the realm of hell. I
must erase Satan's footprints and even his shadow from the realms of the spirit world.
When I have completed my portion of responsibility, God should be able to say, "This is My world, My
heaven and My earth." When there is no distinction between day and night, only brightness 24 hours a
day, the sovereignty will belong to God alone, not to Satan. Only after I hand over everything to God can
I declare that the indemnity has been paid and liberation and complete freedom have been achieved. Then
we will be in the realm where the portion of responsibility is fulfilled.
That realm is the realm of liberation. No longer will there be barriers in the spirit world, such as the
barriers between heaven and hell. The steep valleys in the spirit world will be leveled into plains. All
people will be able to live with their ancestors in the spirit world as they please. If you call out to your
ancestors, they will come to you; and after listening to them, you will be able to follow their guidance.
Once I establish this original standard, God should be able to declare, "I have finished everything." Once I
have completed the ideal of creation, it also means that God has fulfilled His portion of responsibility.
The first human beings fell due to their ignorance of the Principle and its laws. Therefore, True Parents
must teach humanity about these things and create the realm of oneness. Then peace will dwell in the
realm of liberation -- the ideal kingdom of heaven on earth and in heaven, the realm of the original
homeland. Then the liberation of the fatherland, where everyone attends God, will begin. (598-108,
2008/09/19)
24. I have overcome all the obstacles. When I think about what I have done, it seems like a dream. I
wonder, how could I have done all this? I never thought that it was I who did it, not even in my dreams. It
is God who did it. He prepared everything, inside and out. He set up the entire framework; He trained me
and made foundation upon foundation so that I could complete my work. I am saying that heaven toiled
much more than we can ever imagine. That is why, whatever happens in my life, I live without
complaining. (311-107, 1999/08/19)
25. Due to the Fall, human beings lost their original hometown and original fatherland. Yet the planet
Earth is our original homeland; and the place where God dwells is our original fatherland.
Early in my life, I already knew how to become a filial son, a patriot, a saint, a divine son and a king.
When it comes to the fundamental issues, there was nothing that I did not know. That is why I know how
to build the kingdom of heaven on earth and the kingdom of heaven in heaven.
I told you that the era of the Fourth Adam's realm is approaching. On Chil Pal Jeol (7-8 Day), we took
firm root as True Parents. On that basis, on Gu Gu Jeol (9-9 Day) and Sam Shib Jeol (3-10 Day), I
proclaimed the realm of liberation. As the True Parent, I have eliminated everything by which Satan made
himself the false father, and I have recreated the entire basis for God's dominion that Satan destroyed. I
have thereby completed the restoration of everything. By doing so, I have ushered in the era for building
the unified world, the kingdom of heaven on earth based on the ideal of the family.
The original world, the realm which has nothing to do with the Fall, has been empty for thousands of
years, awaiting the Fourth Adam. Now, based on the realm of liberation that I established, this realm will
be filled all at once. The foundation has been completed for God to be liberated, and even for Satan to
receive forgiveness and enter the kingdom of heaven.
I too must be liberated. What liberates me is to rescue the people in the dungeons at the rock bottom of
hell and bring them with me to the kingdom of heaven. (313-282, 1999/12/26)
26. Despite receiving persecution my entire life, I have always lived for the sake of others. This is how I
was able to cover all the levels of opposition, from the individual to the family, tribe, people, nation and
world. Not only have I attained perfection as an individual, I also have completed my mission on all eight
levels, including the family, tribe, people, nation, world, cosmos and God. I completed all this, which
never could be done before, not even during 6,000 years of history. Now that it is finished, the world is no
longer in the course of restoration where we must pay indemnity.
Thus, if you invest yourself with absolute faith and absolute love, centering on the realm of heart of the
Fourth Adam, you will be elevated accordingly. It is like having a highway that takes you effortlessly to
the front gate of the palace. There is nothing to obstruct you. The only questions are your driving skill and
whether you have fuel. We are in the era when you can drive wherever you want to go, as long as you can
supply the gasoline. (332-042, 2000/09/04)
27. God has been leading the providence of salvation not just for one generation but for thousands of
years. Biblically speaking, God has been working in history for the restoration of humankind for 6,000
years. Four thousand years is the length of time that the history of restoration was centered on the chosen
people of Israel, which did not fully succeed. That period is what I had to restore through indemnity
during the last 40 years. I have given Mother all the fortune I accumulated throughout my life. She, in
turn, had to live her life accepting that I, her husband, am also her grandfather, her father and her older
brother. She has actually lived her life with that standard. This is what makes Mother so wonderful. (256-
219, 1994/03/13)
28. What is it that True Parents should accomplish in 2007, a jubilee year of the providence? I came to
earth representing the incorporeal God. I discovered and revealed all the secrets of heaven, earth and
human beings, and brought victory by paying indemnity. Then I passed on my entire victorious
foundation to Mother. On this foundation, Mother held a global speaking tour of 180 nations. Afterward,
with unity between Cain and Abel, she toured 40 nations. The oneness of the family during these tours
was the foundation for the work I did to deal with the providence. All of your families must follow that
path.
Consider that God is the first generation, Adam was the second generation, and Cain and Abel in Adam's
family were the third generation. Didn't God lose the realm of three generations? So I had to win a victory
that included the third generation, Cain and Abel, which I did. Mother also triumphed in this, thus
bringing victory for Eve's realm. Accordingly, both True Parents, Father and Mother, are victorious. (569-

29. I did not mind going to prison. When I went to Pyongyang, I already knew whom I would meet, as if
the meetings had been prearranged. Jesus had 12 disciples, but when he went to prison, they all betrayed
him. In my case, when I was imprisoned I actually found 12 disciples and even more. For restoration
through indemnity, I had to restore all that was lost.
In the future, where should you build a memorial tower to commemorate me? You should memorialize
the places where I experienced prison life. One of those memorials should be at Danbury, where, based on
Mother's unity with me during my incarceration, I proclaimed the realm of ideal oneness between Father
and Mother. (566-183, 2007/06/19)
30. We, the True Parents, opened a new age by completing, concluding and closing the entire history of
the providence of restoration through indemnity. We opened the era of Cheon Il Guk. Now you need to
reach out and educate your neighbors and people of every nation, to enable them to unite with the Will of
our Heavenly Parent and True Parents. That is the best way to satisfy the debt you owe to God in return
for His love and blessings, and to fulfill your mission for humankind. (True Mother, 2013/10/22)
31. The 15th day of the 5th lunar month in 2010 was an important date. On that day, Mother and I
together made a final declaration. At that time, Mother and I came to an agreement on matters about
Korea and other matters pertaining to policies. That was when Mother promised that she would unite with
me regardless of what happened. Based on her promise, we made our declaration. Amid the final battle
with the fallen world, Mother and I made a solemn promise centering on God; that event took place at
3:25 a.m. on the 15th day of the 5th month by the heavenly calendar in 2010.
The hour of that proclamation is significant: three represents the three ages of the Old Testament, New
Testament and Completed Testament. In particular, it signifies that this is the third age, the Completed
Testament Age, which must never fail. Thus we stated, "As we welcome the age for the completion,
conclusion and closure of the Old, New and Completed Testaments, we offer and declare the age in which
the ultimate realm of oneness between True Father and True Mother is perfected and consummated, and
the age in which God is all-immanent, all-transcendent, all-powerful and all-capable." (True Mother,
2010/07/01)
32. O Father, every being in heaven and on earth is totally focused on this day, December 11, 2011. On
this day, True Parents perfected, finalized and consummated the original standard of the Creator. Now,
Father, You have become the Owner of earth. Now heaven and earth, Father and children, and the family
and the world can be totally liberated and enter the state of complete freedom. Accordingly, this is the day
to proclaim the perfection, conclusion and consummation of Your victory as the True Parent of the
Cosmos, and Your victorious supremacy in the world according to the ideal of creation. Mansei to God!
Mansei to True Parents!
Father, as the prince who brought You victory by enabling the family kingdom to come by establishing
the realm of total oneness between the True God and True Parents, I have accomplished everything that
You asked me to fulfill. Based on all these victories, I proclaim that Your sovereignty is now secured. On
this morning we, the Parents of Heaven and Earth who have become one, thank You for giving us this
chance to proclaim that everything is perfected, liberated and concluded. Aju! (True Mother, 2011/12/11)
