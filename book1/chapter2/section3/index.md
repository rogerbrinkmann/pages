## Chapter 2 The Holy Wedding of True Parents and the Era of True Parents 

### Section 3 The Seven-Year Course and the Birth of True Children 

#### The seven-year course 
True Parents' Holy Wedding was performed on the foundation of 14 years of indemnity. The
following seven years was the period in which True Parents' family had to set a condition to be
free from Satan's invasion and complete the foundation of the original family that could enter the
realm of God's direct dominion.
At the Holy Wedding, True Parents' family went beyond the completion level of the growth stage.
During the following seven years, they had to go through the completion stage while fighting
against and prevailing over attacks from the spiritual world and the physical world. At the same
time, that seven-year course was the period during which True Mother had to set the indemnity
condition of absolute obedience to God's Will and during which she was responsible to become
absolutely one with True Father. For True Father, this seven-year course was the period to raise
True Mother to the standard of perfection and thus establish the foundation of a partnership
centered on God's Will. In short, it was the period in which True Father and True Mother had to
unite as one in faith and love, as well as substantially in body.
It was also the period during which the blessed families had to go through their first seven-year
course. True Parents led their family and the blessed families as they pioneered the seven-year
course of the completion stage, a path never before trod in human history. Finally, they
prevailed.
As True Parents went through this seven-year course of internal indemnity, they instituted
Parents' Day, Children's Day and the Day of All Things to recover what had been lost due to the
Human Fall. The ensuing proclamation of God's Day on January 1, 1968 completed this
foundation of victory.
1. What did I do until 1960? Like Jacob, I walked a 14-year course. Thus, although the 7 years starting in
1960 is the first 7-year course for you, for me it is the last part of my 21-year course. Through this 7-year
course, we need to create the heavenly fortune that will enable us to successfully reach out to the people
of this nation. During the first three years, God wanted us to establish the internal standard of the family,
and during the remaining four years, He wants us to establish the external standard in our relations with
society.
In order for us to accomplish this, I had to make the conditions to establish my family as the
representative of all families, of the nation and of the world. For this latter purpose, I set up the Day of All
Things, and upon that foundation I established holy grounds throughout the world. (017-135, 1966/12/11)
2. Jesus should have been able to establish a road of victory based on unity with Joseph's family,
representing David's tribe, and then restore through indemnity the nation of Israel without opposition
from the people. But he was not able do so. Hence, the Unification Church is now working to indemnify
this. This is why I am trying to establish the Unification tribe by restoring individuals, families and clans.
Centering on the Unification tribe, I set up the first seven-year course and worked to fulfill the mission of
restoring the people of the Republic of Korea. Now that we have laid this foundation, Korea cannot block
the path of the Unification Church. I am saying that through this condition, we now stand in the position
of having restored a realm that Jesus wanted to achieve in his time, from which we can launch a new
world with the authority of Jesus' resurrection. By completing the first seven-year course, we set an
indemnity condition on the level of the Korean people to establish the foundation to restore the nation,
which is what Jesus had hoped to do in his time. (019-165, 1968/01/01)
3. In order to dissolve bitter pain and sorrow, the events that caused them must be cleared up and
indemnity must be paid. This is why there must be a course in order to complete restoration. I went
through a course of struggle to restore and perfect Adam and laid the foundation for his victory; hence, I
can stand tall as a man. Likewise, in order for Mother to stand tall as a woman, she as Eve must go
through the course of restoration through indemnity. This requires her to undergo a course of battles in
heart, in body and in faith that no one else can fathom. The path that Mother had to pioneer was as
dangerous as walking a tightrope.
While she was completing that indemnity by the end of her first seven-year course, we instituted Parents'
Day, Children's Day and Day of All Things. Then, on January 1, 1968, we welcomed God's Day.
Thereby, Mother finally gained the qualification as the original woman on earth and stood in a position
equal to mine on the family level. (059-284, 1972/07/27)
4. After paying indemnity to complete my individual course, I established my family in 1960 and entered
the path of the cross on the family level. Since I had to fulfill the mission of indemnifying the 6,000 year
history of the providence, I focused on paying indemnity to carry the cross on the family level more than
on you and the church.
While pursuing this path I instituted Parents' Day, Children's Day and Day of All Things, and when I
completed it, I instituted God's Day. You cannot fathom the internal tribulations Mother and I had to face
and deal with from 1960 until I proclaimed God's Day on the first day of 1968. By winning a victory in
the fight against Satan, I laid the foundation to secure the family level. (030-334, 1970/04/06)
5. During the period of the first seven-year course, we the Parents struggled internally before heaven and
earth. We paid indemnity to clear up all the tangled bitterness and sorrow that originated from the Fall.
This was the period when we could resolve and clear up all the historical circumstances that arose from
Adam and Eve's mistakes in the area of lineage. To move forward, we had to sort out relationships that
could be offered to heaven, offered for the sake of the Will not only in mind but also in body. This is how
we were finally able to complete the first seven-year course and True Parents could emerge into the world
with victory. (077-215, 1975/04/12)
6. The Unification Church launched its activities in earnest in 1960, on the basis of attending Mother.
Despite persistent opposition from the nation and from Christianity, you laid the foundation to push
through that opposition so you could welcome Mother and attend her.
However, this did not mean that Mother could just live with me right away. Just as you had to go through
a three-year period of separation after your marriage Blessing, we too had to do dispensational work in
order to secure our family. The path of the Principle is the same for everyone.
During the first seven-year course I had to indemnify all the complicated problems within the first family,
that of Adam and Eve. Thus, the first seven-year course was the period in which to establish the familylevel foundation, centering on Mother. Since Adam and Eve fell in the completion level of the growth
stage, we had to pass through that level to enter the completion stage. (106-267, 1980/01/01)
7. What has God been doing for the past 6,000 years? What has been His unchanging desire throughout
history? It has been to find the one person, True Mother. It is to find her through Adam, after re-creating
him and sending him to earth. This is re-creation. Originally, God created Adam and then created Eve
from Adam; therefore, for re-creation, Adam has to come to earth first and then find Eve. In other words,
he must find and establish Mother.
In order to do this, during the first seven-year course I had to put Mother on a path that would enable her
to break away from any condition by which Satan's world could accuse her. This means that she does not
need to fight directly with Satan; instead, Mother just has to have absolute faith in me and always unite
with me. Then Satan cannot invade her.
Adam lost Eve because he failed to fulfill his responsibility. Thus, it is Adam who must set the standard
of victory, by restoring his position in relation to Eve as well as bringing Satan to submission. I am
fulfilling this purpose during this seven-year period. Moreover, having established this standard, I have to
raise Mother, in the position of Eve, to that standard in heart and spirit. This is how we can reverse
through indemnity the failure of the fallen parents. This is how we will secure the foundation of the True
Parents. (017-322, 1967/04/10)
8. Had Adam and Eve not fallen, they would have completed this first seven-year course. This was the
path they were required to go to become the True Parents. Therefore, no matter what accusations Satan
threw against us, Mother and I had to make a breakthrough during this time period. I paved this path,
leading the way as the representative of the family during the first seven-year course. During this period,
we, Father and Mother, had to unravel all the tangles of history.
In particular, this seven-year course was the time when I had to reverse Eve's dominion over Adam and
completely secure Adam's authority. For this, I had to educate Eve. In other words, during this period I
had to educate Mother in such a way that she would set a standard of absolute obedience and compliance
before me, even at the cost of her life. (073-245, 1974/09/22)
9. It was not easy for us to secure the family of True Parents. We had to rise all the way to the highest
position in the world. We had to pass through the formation, growth and completion stages. There was a
seven-year course to reach the completion stage. Since Adam and Eve fell away at the completion level of
the growth stage, my family had to walk a seven-year course beginning from that point. Until the
establishment of God's Day on January 1, 1968 Mother had to travel an arduous path as a woman. She
passed heaven's tests without any problem, and this is why she could become what she is today, our great
Mother. (170-034, 1987/11/01) 

#### Establishing the four-position foundation
After the Holy Wedding 14 True Children were born in True Parents' family, starting with the
first daughter, Ye-jin nim, and the first son, Hyo-jin nim. With the births of their first daughter
and their first son, True Parents completed the four-position foundation that Jesus had not been
able to establish. The completion of the four-position foundation in True Parents' family was a
milestone in the providence of restoration that people need to replicate and realize in their own
families.
Even as she gave birth to her children, True Mother shared the same heart as other church
members who were working on the front line. She lived a humble life, eating meager meals of
steamed barley mixed with a small amount of rice, something usually only poor people ate
because they could not afford white rice.
The church members, as the Cain-type children, needed to become one in heart with the True
Children and thus set the condition to be reborn with the same rank, as if they were twins. To
have them meet this condition, at the dedication ceremonies for Ye-jin nim and Hyo-jin nim, True
Parents distributed three kinds of gifts to the members as three conditions of offering, and fed
them three kinds of food: rice, seaweed soup and milk.
10. Through the birth of my sons and daughters, the path has been paved for all of you to be reborn. In
order to be reborn, you have to go through a ceremony that establishes the same conditions as if you had
been nursed on True Mother's milk. So, following Ye-jin's birth, a ceremony was held throughout Korea
in which all members ate some seaweed soup with rice in it. This ceremony was also held when our son
Hyo-jin was born. These ceremonies set the condition that you also were born from True Mother when
she gave birth to those children. (054-225, 1972/03/24)
11. You all should establish the condition that you existed as seeds within me that were yet to be born,
and that then you were reborn through True Mother's womb. You cannot be born on your own, so a
condition has to be fulfilled by which you are born alongside my children. For this purpose, at the birth of
both my first son and first daughter we held a ceremony during which you ate seaweed soup with rice in
it. The first occasion was when Ye-jin arrived. Ye-jin is our first daughter. By paying the necessary
indemnity, I established the condition so that all women who participated in that ceremony were reborn
through True Mother's womb. As a matter of fact, all of you must conduct your own ceremonies in which
you resolve to unite with her for three years. Hyo-jin is our first son, and the men must go through the
same ceremony.
Therefore, all women should celebrate Ye-jin's birthday as the birthday of their Abel, and all men should
celebrate Hyo-jin's birthday as the birthday of their Abel. Then you need a conditional period in which
you become one with him or her substantially. (054-274, 1972/03/25)
12. Before the end of the 4th lunar month of this year 1963, all the entanglements of heart among church
members should be resolved. And then you must pray for blessings upon your enemies. This is a period
when any member who left the church before 1962 will be given the opportunity to return. By doing this
we can set the condition to command Satan's world to open the gate to us. Because I know this time is
coming, I do not hate my enemies. Today is the 21st day since Hyo-jin's birth. On this day, you should
rejoice over him more than Mother and I do. (012-131, 1963/01/18)
13. For the title "True Parents" to be established, there has to be a basis to bring oneness among the
children. Because the first human beings fell, there are two kinds of children in the world: internal
children and external children, or Abel and Cain. From this perspective, the birth of our daughter Ye-jin
and our son Hyo-jin between 1961 and 1963 made a profound contribution to the Providence of
Restoration. Their birth and your oneness with them brought about the Day of All Things. And on the
foundation of their birth, when the first seven-year course came to an end, I was able to proclaim God's
Day.
Ever since 1968, following the end of that first seven-year course, it was possible for the Unification
Church to begin to develop normally. The proclamation of God's Day has the same significance as Adam
and Eve reaching the completion stage in the Garden of Eden without having fallen. (069-301,
1974/01/01)
14. Since Jesus was rejected by the people of Israel, a difficult job lies ahead at his Second Advent. He
needs to restore you to your original position. Of course, since you were already born in the flesh and
have grown up to become adults, you cannot return to the position of a seed within the body of perfected
Adam. Therefore, you need to establish the condition to be born again by uniting with True Children who
were born from True Parents.
There is a principle that through Cain's complete surrender to Abel, both can be restored. Since the True
Children were born free of original sin, they stand in the Abel position. Accordingly, you in the Cain
position need to unite completely with the True Children. By uniting with them you will become
resurrected children and receive the same benefit they receive.
For this reason, when True Children without original sin are born from the True Parents, you have to
establish the condition of having shared the same food and received the same things as they. You should
do this so that you go through the course of participating in the True Children's position.
Through whom can you make the condition to unite with the True Children and be reborn as a child? It is
not only through True Father; that is not enough. You absolutely must go through the True Parents. No
matter how important Father is, you cannot be reborn unless you go through both the Parents and their
children. (055-119, 1972/04/01)
15. For three years, from 1960 to 1963, all the blessed families in Korea went through the course of
restoration on the national level. Since the national-level foundation was lost in Jesus' time, all members
in the church left home and participated in mission activities to restore the nation.
During that time, as they worked on the front line, Father and Mother joined them in heart by eating the
same meager food. When we ate, we did not place our food on the table but on the floor, just as many
members did. When we did so, we had even the child inside True Mother's womb set the condition of
participating with other church members to make the condition to restore the nation. (054-225,
1972/03/24)
16. Some of you here must have eaten seaweed soup when Ye-jin and Hyo-jin were born. This was to
make a condition that both Cain and Abel were born together. You blessed families are in the position of
Cain, so you must attend the True Children in the position of Abel as if they were God or even higher.
You must attend them more sincerely than you attend True Parents.
Do not look at this from a secular viewpoint. Actually, you have been united with them from the time
when both of you were in the womb. You should have been born like twins. As twins, you should restore
the authority of the elder son. As Perez and Zerah reversed their positions as twin sons in the womb of
Tamar, you should reverse your position with a particular True Child. As soon as he or she is born, you
should bring your blessed family to connect with that child with absolute faith, absolute love and absolute
obedience.
These should not be just words. Since God created human beings with absolute faith, absolute love and
absolute obedience, unless you blessed families engraft to the True Parents by demonstrating the same
elements of absolute faith, love and obedience in your own circumstances, you cannot create the realm of
partnership with the people around you. (308-256, 1999/01/10)
17. You cannot enter True Mother's womb, so you must become one with True Parents' infant children.
For three years you need to be in the position of a baby inside the womb. This is why I gave you these
mottoes for the three years from 1960 to 1962: first, "Let this be the year of the best result of our lives,"
second, "Let us become Heavenly Father's representatives," and third, "Let us become people who have
something to show and who can be proud of ourselves." What I mean by "show and be proud of" is the
restoration of the four-position foundation by restoring many people.
Centered on the three stages expressed in my mottoes, all of you must make the condition of eating and
living together with the babies in True Mother's womb. For those three years, Mother ate barley rice, the
same as you did on the front line. When you went out to do church activities, she participated alongside
you in the same activities. Ye-jin and Hyo-jin were born when Mother was making the same conditions
you were making. In other words, Mother lived with the same heart as all of you. (035-228, 1970/10/19)
18. The archangels were supposed to attend, serve and honor Adam and Eve from the moment they were
created until the time they were married. But the angelic world failed to attend Adam and Eve and
became fallen. The bitter sorrow and resentment thus created by the angelic world must be resolved. For
this reason, you need to have three spiritual children and guide them to attend your own children from the
time they are within the womb. Otherwise, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.
You cannot enter the kingdom of heaven with only your own children. Had you established the indemnity
condition of gaining three spiritual children before you received the Blessing, your own children would
not need to have their lineage restored. If you are unable to achieve this condition before you go to the
spirit world, it will become a stumbling block for you.
In the 1960s, I already had made all the required conditions of restoring spiritual children while my
children were in their mother's womb. After their birth, you were given seaweed soup, milk and rice. That
was the condition I set up for all of you to have the same birth as the True Children. (023-316,
1969/06/08)
19. Until 1963, True Parents worked with you, sharing your situation and eating humble meals of barley
rice. We had to set that indemnity condition for three years on the family level. At the same time, you had
to go out and struggle to give birth to your spiritual children. Just as you ate barley rice, True Parents also
had to eat it. Now we will have to offer our sons and daughters internally when we go to America for a
course of sacrifice on the world level. This is what we have to do.
All of you ate seaweed soup with rice after Ye-jin was born; it was as if you were receiving blood from
Mother while inside her womb. As Mother ate soup with rice in it, you ate the same food, which was like
receiving her blood. It was the same when Hyo-jin was born. Based on this foundation, I established
Children's Day and then the Day of All Things. It was because we attained such a standard that I had the
foundation to establish these holy days of blessing. Thereupon, when the first seven-year course came to
an end and True Parents' family was liberated, I instituted God's Day. (047-340, 1971/08/30)
